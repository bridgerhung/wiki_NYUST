[Intro]  
Ooh-ooh-ooh  
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Brown guilty eyes and  
充滿罪惡的棕色眼神  
Little white lies, yeah

That you talked to her, maybe did even worse

There's no damn way that you  
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly  
還真的沒有其他該死的原因可以讓你這麼快跳船。  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ain't it funny? All the twisted games  
不好笑嗎，那些莫名其妙的遊戲  
All the questions you used to avoid

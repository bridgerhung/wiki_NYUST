[Verse 1: Julia Lester]

Seems like a part of me will always have to lose

我的身體漸漸分崩離析

Every single time I have to choose

每一次我都面臨困難抉擇

Swore that it felt right, but was I wrong?

試著要讓一切好起來，但我錯了嗎？

Is this where I'm supposed to be at all?

這裡是我的歸屬嗎？

I don’t have the answers, not today

今天的我依舊沒有答案

It's like nothing makes the questions go away

看似不管做什麼，問題依舊存在

What I'd give to see if the grass was greener

放眼望去，草是否比昨日更青綠了呢？

[Pre-Chorus: Julia Lester]

On the other side of all I’ve had and lost

我得到，卻又悵然若失

Would it be enough or would I still be

wondering?

這是否足夠，還是我依舊彷徨未知？

[Chorus: Julia Lester]

If I could go back and change the past

若我能回到過去，改變一切

Be a little braver than I had

比原本的我更勇敢一些

And bet against the odds

下定決心戰勝不可能

Would I still be lost?

我是否還會徬徨不定

Even if I woke up in my dreams

即使我在夢中醒來

Would there still be something I'm missing?

是否天上還會掛著迷失的星星？

If I had everything, would it mean anything to me?

若我擁有一切，是否一切都有了意義

Ooh

[Verse 2: Olivia Rodrigo]

Feels like I might have broke the best thing that I had

我好像破壞了我曾經擁有的美好

I said too much to ever take it back

我說的太多，而一切再也不能挽回

Scared I'll never find something as good

害怕我再也找到不到一樣好的

And would I even know it if I could?

我也不知道我是否做得到

[Pre-Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo, Julia Lester, Both]

On the other side of all I’ve had and lost

我得到，卻又悵然若失

Would it be enough or would I still be

wondering?

這是否足夠，還是我依舊彷徨未知？

(Or would I still be wondering, oh)

[Chorus: Julia Lester & Olivia Rodrigo]

Chorus: Julia Lester]

If I could go back and change the past

若我能回到過去，改變一切

Be a little braver than I had

比原本的我更勇敢一些

And bet against the odds

下定決心戰勝不可能

Would I still be lost?

我是否還會徬徨不定

Even if I woke up in my dreams

即使我在夢中醒來

Would there still be something I'm missing?

是否天上還會掛著迷失的星星？

If I had everything, would it mean anything ?

若我擁有一切，是否一切都有了意義

[Bridge: Olivia Rodrigo, Both]

Maybe I should turn around and take the other road

窮途末路是不是該換條路

Or maybe I'm just lookin' for what I already know

或許我只是在找尋我心中已經有的答案

I'm just wondering

我只是想知道

[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo, Both]

Chorus: Julia Lester]

If I could go back and change the past

若我能回到過去，改變一切

Be a little braver than I had

比原本的我更勇敢一些

And bet against the odds

下定決心戰勝不可能

Would I still be lost?

我是否還會徬徨不定

Even if I woke up in my dreams

即使我在夢中醒來

Would there still be something I'm missing?

是否天上還會掛著迷失的星星？

If I had everything, would it mean anything to me?

若我擁有一切，是否一切都有了意義

[Outro: Julia Lester]

Would it be enough

這是否足夠

Or would I still be wondering?

或者我只是想望

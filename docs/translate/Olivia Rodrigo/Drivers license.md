## 翻譯
[Verse 1]

I got my driver's license last week

我上星期剛拿到駕照

Just like we always talked about

那時我們還談笑盛歡

'Cause you were so excited for me

你著實為我高興

To finally drive up to your house

終於可以開著車到你的家

But today I drove through the suburbs

但今天我開過郊區

Crying 'cause you weren't around

因為你未陪在我身旁，我默默地掉著眼淚

[Verse 2]

And you're probably with that blonde girl

你找了個新的金髮女孩

Who always made me doubt

總是讓我好吃醋

She's so much older than me

她年紀比我大得多

She's everything I'm insecure about

她是我不安全感的來源

Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs

今天我路過郊區

'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

我深陷過去，我能夠放下你，再愛別人嗎？

[Chorus]

And I know we weren't perfect

我知道我們並不完美

But I've never felt this way for no one

我從未這樣孤身一人

And I just can't imagine

我無法想像

How you could be so okay now that I'm gone

你為什麼離開我後，一點都無所謂的樣子

Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me

我猜，你在你的歌裡面寫給我的，肯定不是你的真意

'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

因為這段情本該永恆，但如今我孤身一人

[Verse 3]

And all my friends are tired

我的朋友都聽到耳朵長繭

Of hearing how much I miss you, but

聽著我說，我的我想念你

I kinda feel sorry for them

我對他們好抱歉

'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah

他們永遠不會感同身受曾經的感情

Today I drove through the suburbs

今日我開過你住的郊區

And pictured I was driving home to you

那段我載著你回家的記憶尤新

[Chorus]

And I know we weren't perfect

我知道我們並不完美

But I've never felt this way for no one

我從未這樣孤身一人

And I just can't imagine

我無法想像

How you could be so okay now that I'm gone

你為什麼離開我後，一點都無所謂的樣子

Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me

我猜，你在你的歌裡面寫給我的，肯定不是你的真意

'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

因為這段情本該永恆，但如今我孤身一人

[Bridge]

Red lights, stop signs

黃燈閃爍，紅燈亮起

I still see your face in the white cars, front yards

停在前院的雪白汽車，你的臉，畫面在腦中隱隱作痛

Can't drive past the places we used to go to

我再也去不了佈滿我們回憶的地方

'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

但我還放不下你

Sidewalks we crossed

我們走過的漫漫長路

I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing

Over all the noise

喧囂的聲響，有熟悉的，你的回音，我們的笑聲穿過大街，走過小巷

God, I'm so blue, know we're through

雙膝跪地，神，我好痛苦，愛在心中淌血

But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

因為我心中還有你

[Chorus]

I know we weren't perfect

我知道我們並不完美

But I've never felt this way for no one

我從未這樣孤身一人

And I just can't imagine

我無法想像

How you could be so okay now that I'm gone

你為什麼離開我後，一點都無所謂的樣子

Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me

我猜，你在你的歌裡面寫給我的，肯定不是你的真意

'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

因為這段情本該永恆，但如今我孤身一人

[Outro]

Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

因為這段情本該永恆，但如今我孤身一

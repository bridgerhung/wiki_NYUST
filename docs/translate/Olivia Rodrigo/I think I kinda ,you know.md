## 翻譯
So much has happened

經歷了許多事

Think of what we've done

回頭看看過去的所為

In the time that the Earth

在地球上的一切

Has traveled 'round the Sun

繞著太陽轉的時光

Winter, spring, summer

走過寒冬、生春、炎夏

And we're back to fall

又回到楓葉拂去的秋

We've been together

我們一直彼此相伴

Hand-in-hand through it all

手牽著手走過一切

[Pre-Chorus 1: Olivia Rodrigo]

From the minute we kissed

回到親吻的前一秒

And my heart skipped a beat

我的心跳落了一拍

To the night that we danced

那晚我在房裡與你共舞

I was swept off my feet

我被你迷的神魂顛倒

Sure as every year has to come to an end

年年總是會走過一回

I'd go spinning 'round the Sun

我會繞著你這顆太陽不斷旋轉

With you again and again

被你深深地吸引著

And again and again

不斷的旋轉著

[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo, Joshua Bassett, Both]

I think I kinda, you know

我想你早就知道

I think I kinda, you know

我猜，你心裡早就有譜

Like the way that we flow

愛的能量在彼此之間不斷湧動

Like the way that we go

就像走過的漫漫長路都生起玫瑰

And I love

而我愛

I think I kinda, you know

我猜，你心裡早就知道

I think I kinda, you know

我想，我和你心心相印

I think I kinda, you know

我想，我們共譜著

You know, you know

我倆的歌

[Verse 2: Joshua Bassett]

Sometimes you know

有時總是有什麼

Exactly what to say

想要說的話

Then you open your mouth

但每次張開嘴

And the words go away

那些話又吞回肚子裡

Don't want you to wonder

但我不想讓你去猜

Or to doubt or guess

去想，去疑惑

So let me tell you clearly

請讓我完整的說出那些話

What I'm tryin' to express

讓我好好的回應你的心意

[Pre-Chorus 2: Joshua Bassett]

It's just three little words

只是簡單的那三個字

Yeah, it's not a big deal

聽起來沒什麼的大不了

It's not like I can help

但總是難以回應

Feelin' all that I feel

我心中的真實響應

And by now, I'm sure

但我現在，終於肯定

You're thinkin' it's so obvious

我的臉看起來好明顯

But just in case it's not

但我說的

What I'm sayin' is this, what I'm sayin' is this

總是非我心中所想，我心中的想要

[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo, Joshua Bassett, Both]

I think I kinda, you know

我想你早就知道

I think I kinda, you know

我猜，你心裡早就有譜

Like the way that we flow

愛的能量在彼此之間不斷湧動

Like the way that we go

就像走過的漫漫長路都生起玫瑰

And I love

而我愛

I think I kinda, you know

我猜，你心裡早就知道

I think I kinda, you know

我想，我和你心心相印

I think I kinda, you know

我想，我們共譜著

You know, you know

我倆的歌

[Bridge: Olivia Rodrigo, Joshua Bassett, Both]

You know how we can talk all night

我們在床上徹夜長談

And not run outta things to talk about

無話不說，無所不談

It's rare that somethin' feels this right

和你相處似乎打中心裡的某一處

It feels so right

喜悅難以言喻，又讓我欲罷不能

[Chorus 2: Olivia Rodrigo, Joshua Bassett, Both]

I think I kinda, you know

我想，我和你心心相印

I think I kinda, you know

我想，我們共譜著

You know, you know

我倆的歌

I think I kinda, you know

我猜，你心裡早就知道

I think I kinda, you know

我想，我和你心心相印

I think I kinda, you know

我想，我們共譜著

You know, you know

我倆的歌

[Outro: Olivia Rodrigo, Joshua Bassett, Both]

I can't help dreamin' of you

每一晚，你都出現在我的夢境

Guess I'm sayin' I don't not love you

我想，我是想說，我不是不愛你

You know, you know, you know

你懂，你懂，你都懂

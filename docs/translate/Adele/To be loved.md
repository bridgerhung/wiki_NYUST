[Verse 1]  
I built a house for a love to grow

I'm as lost now as I was back then

All I do is bleed into someone else

Painting walls with all my secret tears  
在自己的房間，淚水滴入顏料去彩繪我的白色牆面  
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears

[Pre-Chorus]  
But, oh, my

Oh, my

I'll never learn if I never leap

I'll always yearn if I never speak

I'm so afraid, but I'm open wide  
我很害怕，但我敞開了心門  
I'll be the one to catch myself this time  
此時此地，我會去接住我自己  
Tryna learn to lean into it all  
試著學習去向自己靠攏  
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?  
看著偉大日漸衰落，是不是很有趣?  
Looking back, I don't regret a thing  
回首過往，我不後悔我做的所有選擇  
Yeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning  
我轉了很多彎，才回到我自己身上  
I'll stand still and let the storm pass by  
我會矗立在原地，等待暴風雨過境  
Keep my heart safe till the time feels right  
持守安穩心境，等到適合的時刻來臨

Even started lying to you

What a thing to do  
這是在江湖該做的事情吧  
All because I wanted

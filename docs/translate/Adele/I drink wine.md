## 翻譯
[Verse 1]  
How can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?  
為甚麼人總是會受到他人的決定所影響?  
How come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like?  
我甚麼我們都成為我們不喜歡的樣子?  
We're in love with the world, but the world just wants to bring us down  
我們愛這個世界，屆屆卻將我們往下拖  
By puttin' ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow  
把別人的想法硬塞進我們的腦袋，讓我們的心腐爛沒有知覺  
When I was a child, every single thing could blow my mind  
當我是個孩子時，任何風吹草動，都會驚擾我的思緒  
Soaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine  
每天沉浸在歡樂中，但現在只有我一人泡在葡萄酒中  
They say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice  
人們說，用力的玩，用力的工作，在犧牲中找到平衡  
And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied  
我不曉得，到底有誰，會對這種生活滿意?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin', tryin')  
請你相信我盡力了  
To keep climbin' (Climbin', climbin')  
努力往上爬  
But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser  
我們爬得愈高，但智慧似乎未隨之增長。  

[Chorus]  
So I hope I learn to get over myself  
所以我希望我學著去接納我自己  
Stop tryin' to be somebody else  
不再去假扮他人  
So we can love each other for free  
我們能夠毫無條件的去愛人  
Everybody wants somethin', you just want me  
每一個人都想要更多，你只想要我  
  
[Verse 2]  
Why am I obsessin' about the things I can't control?  
我為甚麼總是被無法控制的事情所困擾?  
Why am I seekin' approval from people I don't even know?  
為甚麼我總是尋覓著陌生人的認同?  
In these crazy times, I hope to find somethin' I can cling on to  
在狂風暴雨中，我總是想找個岩壁往上爬。
'Cause I need some substance in my life, somethin' real, somethin' that feels true  
因為我需要新的東西注入我的生命，一種真實的屬於我的想法。  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You better believe for you, I've cried (I've cried, I've cried)  
請你相信，我流淚了  
High tides (High tides, high tides)  
像是高漲的海浪  
'Cause I want you so bad, but you can't fight fire with fire, oh  
我想著你，但我沒辦法提油救火  
  
[Chorus]  
So I hope I learn to get over myself  
所以我希望我學著去接納我自己  
Stop tryin' to be somebody else

Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free  
我想愛你，自由的愛你  
Everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me  
因為每個人都想從我身上拿些甚麼，而你只是接納我  
  
[Bridge]  
Listen, I know how low I can go, I give as good as I get  
聽著，我知道我能走得多低，我用盡了我的全部  
You get the brunt of it all 'cause you're all I've got left  
你得到了我給予的一切，因為你是我唯一的歸處  
Oh, I hope in time (Hope in time)  
我希望改變及時到來  
We both will find peace of mind (We both find)  
我們內心得以平和  
Sometimes, the road less travelled is a road best left behind  
有時候，少有人走過的路，最好別經過  
  
[Chorus]  
So I hope I learn to get over myself  
所以我希望我學著去接納我自己  
Stop tryin' to be somebody else  
不再去假扮他人  
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free, yeah  
我只想愛你，自由的愛你  
'Cause everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me  
因為每個人都想從我身上拿些甚麼，而你只是接納我  
  
[Refrain]  
You better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin', tryin')  
請你相信我盡力了  
To keep climbin' (Climbin', climbin')

But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser

[Outro]  
The only regret I have

I wish that it was just at a different time  
就是我希望我能重來過  
A most turbulent period of my life

Why would I put that on you?  
為甚麼我當時要你為我負重?  
That's just, like, a very heavy thing to have to talk about  
那些問題都是沉重，難解的事物。   
But because of that period of time  
但也是因為那個時期  
Even though it was so much fun  
儘管那一段時間是多棒，多迷人  
I didn't get to go on and make new memories with him  
我最終都沒法留下他，沒辦法創造更多回憶  
There was just memories in a big storm    
最後，美好回憶，只能在龍捲風裡被撕成碎片，變塵風

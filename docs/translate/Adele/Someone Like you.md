>「像你一樣的人」「一個喜歡你的人」

I heard that you're settled down

我聽說你有歸屬了

That you found a girl and you're married now

你找到一個適合你的，並娶了他

I heard that your dreams came true

我聽說你的夢想成真了

Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you

我想他給了你，我沒有給你的

Old friend, why are you so shy?

老朋友， 為何這麼害羞

Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

為畏縮縮的，躲在陰暗的角落

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited

我討厭 突如其來的出現，不請自來

But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

我沒辦法離開 情不自禁

I had hoped you'd see my face

我好希望你當下看著我的臉

And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

然後對著我說 ，一切都還沒有結束

Never mind, I'll find someone like you

算了吧，我會找個和你一樣好的

I wish nothing but the best for you, too

沒有什麼好祝福， 但希望你幸福

"Don't forget me, " I beg

I remember you said

“不要忘記我”， 希望我會記得你說過

"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"

有時愛是不滅的， 但傷痕卻是永恆的

"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"

有時愛是不滅的， 但傷痕卻是永恆的

You know how the time flies

時間飛速流逝

Only yesterday was the time of our lives

我們共同生活的記憶 似乎只停留在過去

We were born and raised in a summer haze

我們在夏日裡出生並長大

Bound by the surprise of our glory days

光輝的歲月成長的喜悅構成了我們的紐帶

{bridge}

Nothing compares, no worries or cares

沒有比較，無憂無愁

Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made

錯誤和後悔， 回憶已經留下

Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

誰又知道那一段回憶的酸甜苦辣？

Never mind, I'll find someone like you

算了吧，我會找個和你一樣好的

I wish nothing but the best for you, too

沒有什麼好祝福， 但希望你幸福

"Don't forget me, " I beg

I remember you said

“不要忘記我”， 希望我會記得你說過

"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"

有時愛是不滅的， 但傷痕卻是永恆的

"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"

有時愛是不滅的， 但傷痕卻是永恆的

[Intro]  
  
I walked through the door with you  
我和你一起走進門  
The air was cold  
空氣瀰漫我們呼出的水氣  
But something 'bout it felt like home  
但這裡隱隱約約有家的氣息  
somehow, and I  
而我  
Left my scarf there at your sister's house  
把我的圍巾落在你姐姐的房子  
And you've still got it  
而現在還藏在你的抽屜  
In your drawer, even now  
直到現在  
  
[Verse 1]  
Oh, your sweet disposition  
你甜甜的臉  
And my wide-eyed gaze  
而我大大的眼注視著你  
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate  
我們在荒郊野外車上高歌  
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place  
秋盡風來，楓葉片片回歸塵土  
And I can picture it after all these days  
而落下的一片，一直夾在我的相框  
直到現在  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
And I know it's long gone and  
我知道已經過了許久  
That magic's not here no more  
魔力早就隨風沙而逝  
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all  
我感覺還好，但其實心底有著疙瘩  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
[Chorus 1]  
'Cause there we are again on that little town street  
曾經我們在小鎮街上相遇  
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me  
你闖了紅燈，在對街注視著我  
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well  
風髮拂起，我矗立在此，一切記憶猶新  
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah  
樓梯下，我在那裡，一切記憶猶新  
  
[Verse 2]  
Photo album on the counter  
相簿掛在斑駁的牆上  
Your cheeks were turning red  
你的臉頰曾日漸紅潤  
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed  
你曾是帶著眼鏡躺在小床的男孩  
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team  
還記得你媽媽講著你打樂樂棒球的故事  
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me  
你講著你的過去，我想著，我在你生命中的未來 
   
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
And I know it's long gone and  
這已經是陳年往事  
There was nothing else I could do  
已經無從改變  
And I forget about you long enough  
而我已經忘記你夠久了  
To forget why I needed to  
忘記為什麼當初將你抹去  
  
[Chorus 2]  
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night  
當初我們在午夜又回到那個地方  
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light  
我們在廚房裡亮著冰箱燈跳舞  
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah  
樓梯下，我在那裡，一切記憶猶新  
  
[Bridge]  
Well, maybe we got lost in translation  
或許我們無法溝通  
Maybe I asked for too much  
或許是我要求太多  
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece  
或許是因為這樣  
'Til you tore it all up  
你撕裂了一切  
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well  
害怕而逃跑，我就在那，一切歷歷在目  
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise  
而你打電話給我，撕裂我們曾經立下的誓約  
So casually cruel in the name of being honest  
以誠實之名，隨意的撕裂我的心靈  
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here  
我瞬間碎裂，像落下的紙屑  
'Cause I remember it all, all, all  
Too well  
我記憶猶新，刻骨銘心  
  
[Verse 3]  
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it  
時間如流沙，而早就深陷流沙而麻痺  
I'd like to be my old self again  
好想回到舊我  
But I'm still trying to find it  
我依舊在找尋，以前的回憶  
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own  
自從依畏在你的身上的時光消逝而去  
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone  
而你現在把我的舊物寄回來  
But you keep my old scarf  
獨獨缺少我的圍巾  
From that very first week  
從寄來的第一周  
'Cause it reminds you of innocence  
他讓我想起你依舊天真無邪  
And it smells like me  
圍巾上我的味道猶存  
You can't get rid of it  
你難以擺脫  
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah  
因為，你記憶猶新  
  
[Chorus 3]  
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so  
我們又回到那個，曾經愛發生的地方  
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known  
趁著那個地方還保留著我們的餘溫  
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well  
這地方寄託回憶，珍貴的結晶，  
我在那，一切記憶猶新  
  
[Outro]  
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all  
風髮拂起，你矗立在此，一切都記憶猶新  
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all  
樓梯下，你在那裡，一切都記憶猶新  
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well  
這地方寄託回憶的珍貴結晶，  
我在那，一切記憶猶新

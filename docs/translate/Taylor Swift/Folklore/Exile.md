[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]

I can see you standing, honey

在路上遇見了你

With his arms around your body

他的手摟著你的腰

Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all

你們笑著，但那笑話一點也不好笑

And it took you five whole minutes

你過去只花了5分鐘

To pack us up and leave me with it

就將我們的愛打包

Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

只剩我留在大廳空無廖人

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]

I think I've seen this film before

好似我曾見這一幕

And I didn't like the ending

但我不喜歡這樣的結尾

You're not my homeland anymore

你再也不是我的港灣

So what am I defending now?

所以我還在這留守什麼？

You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out

你曾是我的歸屬，但我卻流亡他鄉，望你離去

I think I've seen this film before

我好似曾在電影見過這一幕

[Post-Chorus: Justin Vernon]

Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]

I can see you starin', honey

我看到你注視著我

Like he's just your understudy

好似我旁邊的這一位是你的替補演員

Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me

好似你要上前為我流血

Second, third, and hundredth chances

二次三次機會

Balancin' on breaking branches

試著平衡搖搖欲墜的一切

Those eyes add insult to injury

那副眼神在傷口上灑了侮辱

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]

I think I've seen this film before

我想我曾在電影上見過這一幕

And I didn't like the ending

但這是我不喜歡的結局

I'm not your problem anymore

我不再是你的負擔

So who am I offending now?

所以我冒犯了誰？

You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out

你曾是我的港灣，但我卻流亡他鄉，望你離去

I think I've seen this film before

我想我曾見過這一幕

So I'm leaving out the side door

所以我只能從旁黯然離去

[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift & Both]

So step right out, there is no amount

我們都離開吧，沒有什麼事情

Of crying I can do for you

使我能夠在為你哭泣

All this time

一直以來

We always walked a very thin line

我們的愛情都走在鋼索上

You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)

你從未認真聽我說（你從未認真聽我說）

You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

All this time

你從未給我暗示和機會（我給了多少暗示和機會）

I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)

我從來都讀不懂你的想法（讀不懂我的想法）

I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)

我無法讓事情轉圜（你從未挽回一切）

'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

從未給我暗示和機會（我給了很多次）

So many signs, so many signs

多少暗示，多少機會

You didn't even see the signs

你從未看到那些警示

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]

I think I've seen this film before

我想我曾在電影經過這一幕

And I didn't like the ending

但我不喜歡這個結尾

You're not my homeland anymore

你不再是我的港灣

So what am I defending now?

所以我還在這裡守護什麼？

You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out

你曾是我的家，但我流落他處，望你而去

I think I've seen this film before

我想我曾見過這一幕

So I'm leavin' out the side door

所以我只好從旁離開

[Outro: Justin Vernon & Taylor Swift]

So step right out, there is no amount

我們都離開吧，沒有什麼事情

Of crying I can do for you

使我能夠在為你哭泣

All this time

一直以來

We always walked a very thin line

我們的愛情都走在鋼索上

You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)

你從未認真聽我說（你從未認真聽我說）

You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

All this time

你從未給我暗示和機會（我給了多少暗示和機會）

I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)

我從來都讀不懂你的想法（讀不懂我的想法）

I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)

我無法讓事情轉圜（你從未挽回一切）

'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

從未給我暗示和機會（我給了很多次）

So many signs, so many signs

多少暗示，多少機會

You didn't even see the signs

你從未看到那些警示

You never gave a warning sign (All this time)

你從未給我僅是（一直以來）

(So many times) I never learned to read your mind

（給你許多次）無法讀懂你的想法

(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)

（給你許多信號）我無法讓事情轉圜

'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)

你從來沒有給我緊示（你從來沒有給我緊示）

You never gave a warning sign

你從來沒有透漏過信號

Ah, ah

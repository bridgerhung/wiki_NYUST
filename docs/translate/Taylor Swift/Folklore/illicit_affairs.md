## 翻譯
[Verse 1]  
Make sure nobody sees you leave  
別讓任何人看到你離開  
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down  
戴上帽子，低頭快步前行  
Tell your friends you're out for a run  
告訴你的朋友，你出去慢跑了  
You’ll be flushed when you return  
當你回到這裡時，你已經被刷洗過一遍了。  
Take the road less traveled by  
走一條不熟悉的小徑  
Tell yourself you can always stop  
告訴自己，你隨時都可以停下來  
What started in beautiful rooms  
在房間發生的美好一切  
Ends with meetings in parking lots  
一切都在停車場的最後一次見面嘎然止息  
  
[Chorus]  
And that's the thing about illicit affairs  
那就是一次偷偷摸摸的私情  
And clandestine meetings and longing stares  
不見光的會面，遙遠長久的凝視  
It's born from just one single glance  
情愫在一眨眼快速湧現  
But it dies and it dies and it dies  
但總是快速的消散而逝  
A million little times  
燃灰成燼無數次    
  
[Verse 2]  
Leave the perfume on the shelf  
在桌上留下那瓶香水  
That you picked out just for him  
曾決定，在此生，只為他留的香韻  
So you leave no trace behind  
你不著痕跡的溜走  
Like you don’t even exist  
就好像你未曾存在過  
Take the words for what they are  
把這些話當成是毒品  
A dwindling, mercurial high  
需要增加劑量才能維持的欣快感  
A drug that only worked  
但那些藥  
The first few hundred times  
也只作用那剛使用的那幾次  
  
[Chorus]  
And that's the thing about illicit affairs  
那就是一次偷偷摸摸的私情  
And clandestine meetings and longing stares  
不見光的會面，遙遠長久的凝視  
They show their truth one single time  
那些糖衣毒藥展現過一次欣快們的真實  
But they lie and they lie and they lie  
但他們卻是有千百萬次的  
A million little times  
不斷破碎的謊言  
  
[Bridge]  
And you wanna scream  
你想大喊  
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"  
別稱我小孩子，別喚我寶貝  
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me  
看看你所做的好事，你弄得我一團糟  
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else  
你創造了只有我能見著的七彩斑斕  
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"  
別稱我小孩子，別喚我寶貝  
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me  
你讓我看起來是個自討苦吃的傻子  
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else  
你創造了只有我倆能夠理解的世界，無法向他人所言  
  
[Outro]  
And you know damn well  
你都知道這一切  
For you, I would ruin myself  
對你來說，是我自願毀壞我自己  
A million little times  
一遍一遍反覆循環

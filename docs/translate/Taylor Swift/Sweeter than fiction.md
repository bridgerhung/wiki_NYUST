[Verse 1]

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground (oh, oh)

腳踏地面，腳踏地面

Only sound, only sound that you hear is "no"

你聽著，不可能，的泄氣聲

You never saw it coming

你看不見終點

Slipped when you started running

當你要起跑時滑倒了

And now you've come undone and (I, I, I, I)

而一切都未完成，半途而廢

Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees (eh, eh)

看著你陷落，雙膝跪地匍匐前進

Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade

看著你吃下敗仗，看著你喪氣黯淡

Wish I could make it better

希望我能讓一切好轉

Someday you won't remember

總有一天這記憶會消逝

This pain you thought would last forever and ever

忘記你曾經以為永恆的痛苦

[Chorus 1]

There you stand, ten feet tall

看著你，站著巨人般10呎高

I will say, "I knew it all along"

我說著，我就知道你做的到

Your eyes are wider than distance

你堅毅的眼神，碧海藍天盡收眼底

This life is sweeter than fiction

這生活比幻想還精彩

[Verse 2]

Just a shot, just a shot in the dark (oh, oh)

錯失的機會，與你閃身而過

All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes

只剩下，只剩下，破碎的信心

They never saw it coming

他們看不見終點線

You hit the ground running

你腳踏地面向前衝

And now you're on to something

I, I, I say

What a sight, what a sight when the light came on

燈亮起之時，成就一幅良辰美景

Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong

向世界告訴他們是錯的，向我證明你是對的

And in this perfect weather

現在已經雨過天晴

It's like we don't remember

光明已經退散黑暗

The rain we thought would last forever and ever

那場以為會一直下的大雨，早已退去

[Chorus 2]

There you stand, ten feet tall

看著你，站著巨人般10呎高

I will say, "I knew it all along"

我說著，我就知道你做的到

Your eyes are wider than distance

你堅毅的眼神，碧海藍天盡收眼底

This life is sweeter than fiction

這生活比幻想還精彩

There you stand, next to me

看著你，站在我身旁

All at once, the rest is history

頃刻間，笑容和驕傲寫下光榮的歷史

Your eyes are wider than distance

你堅毅的眼神，碧海藍天盡收眼底

This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

這生活比小說還精彩

[Bridge]

I’ll be one of the many saying

我是那一個對你說的人

Look at you now, look at you now, now

看看現在的你，看看你

I’ll be one of the many saying

我是那一個對你說的人

You made us proud, you made us proud, proud

你讓我們為你驕傲，與有榮焉

I’ll be one of the many saying

我是群聲讚揚的其中一個

Look at you now, look at you now, now

看看現在的你，看看你

I’ll be one of the many saying

我是群聲讚揚的其中一個

You made us proud, you made us proud, proud

你讓我們為你驕傲，與有榮焉

And when they call your name

到他們喊出你的名子時

And they put your picture in a frame

他們將你的榮耀留在相框裏

You know that I’ll be there time and again

你知道你會一再一再的重返榮耀

'Cause I loved you when

我最喜歡你

When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh

當你震懾全場，霸氣十足

Only sound, only sound that you heard was "no"

只有必勝必勝的決心

Now in this perfect weather

現在已經雨過天晴

It's like we don't remember

光明已經退散黑暗

The rain we thought would last forever and ever

那場以為會一直下的大雨，早已退去

[Chorus 2]

There you stand, ten feet tall

看著你，站著巨人般10呎高

I will say, "I knew it all along"

我說著，我就知道你做的到

Your eyes are wider than distance

你堅毅的眼神，碧海藍天盡收眼底

This life is sweeter than fiction

這生活比幻想還精彩

There you stand, next to me

看著你，站在我身旁

All at once, the rest is history

頃刻間，笑容和汗水成了一幅畫

Your eyes are wider than distance

你堅毅的眼神，碧海藍天盡收眼底

This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

這生活比小說還精彩

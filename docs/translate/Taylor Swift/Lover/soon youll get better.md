[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]  
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair

I know delusion when I see it in the mirror

You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal

I just pretend it isn't real  
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky

And I hate to make this all about me

If there's no you?

[Verse 1]

Looking at it now

回首過往

It all seems so simple

一切都很單純

We were lying on your couch

當初我們躺在沙發上

I remember

我還記得

You took a Polaroid of us

你為我們拍了張拍立得

Then discovered (Then discovered)

甩一甩，記憶浮現

The rest of the world was black and white

裡頭的世界剩下黑和白色

But we were in screaming color

但我們依舊七彩斑斕

And I remember thinking

而我忽然憶起

[Chorus]

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?

我們是否已經離開危險的叢林？

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?

我們已經離開險境？

Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?

我們是否安然無恙？

Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good

yet?

我們是否又破鏡重圓，已經好起來了嗎？，那就好

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?

我們是否已經離開危險的叢林？

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?

我們是否離開險境？

Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?

我們是否安然無恙？

Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good

yet?

我們是否又破鏡重圓，已經好起來了嗎？，那就好

(Are we out of the woods?)

逃出危林

[Verse 2]

Looking at it now

回首過往

Last December (Last December)

上一個12月

We were built to fall apart

我們註定要破碎

Then fall back together (Back together)

再修補回來

Your necklace hanging from my neck

你的項鍊掛在我的脖子

The night we couldn't quite forget

那一晚寫在我的腦海裡

When we decided, we decided

我們決定

To move the furniture so we could dance

移動家具，好讓我們跳舞

Baby, like we stood a chance

寶貝，就像有機會握在手裡

Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

就像射出的紙飛機，飛起又墜地

And I remember thinking

而我忽然憶起

[Bridge]

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?

還記得我們在路上車子打滑

Twenty stitches in a hospital room

在醫院縫了20幾針

When you started crying, baby, I did too

當你淚如雨下，我的眼淚也滴滴落下

But when the sun came up, I was looking at you

但太陽透進房間裡，我也注視著你

Remember when we couldn't take the heat?

還記得我們受不了別人的閒言閒語？

I walked out and said, "I'm setting you free"

當你受不了那炙熱，我離開並說：我放你自由

But the monsters turned out to be just trees

叢林嚇人的怪物，其實只是樹

When the sun came up, you were looking at me

當太陽升起時，陽光灑下我的目光照映著你

You were looking at me, ooh

你正注視著我

You were looking at me

你正注視著我

## 翻譯
The drought was the very worst, ah ah  
土地乾裂，毫無生氣  
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst  
我們一同種的花朵，因為缺水而枯萎  
It was months, and months of back and forth, ah ah  
反反復復好幾個月  
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore  
你像我衣裳上的酒漬，而我再也不能穿上  
Hung my head, as I lost the war, and the sky  
天崩地裂，低頭啜泣  
turned black like a perfect storm  
天空烏雲籠罩，像個完美的風暴  
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning  
我奄奄一息，雨水傾瀉而下  
That's when I could finally breathe  
那一刻，我終於浮上水面，得以呼吸  
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean  
雨過天青，沒了你的足跡，一切清澈透明  
There was nothing left to do, ah ah  
沒什麼可做的，無可挽回  
When the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room  
當飛舞的蝴蝶回歸塵土，塵土覆蓋了整個房間  
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah ah  
我在屋頂鑿了個洞  
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you  
讓洪水沖走你的回憶  
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing  
水灌進我的喉嚨，我嘶吼但無人聽見  
Ten months sober, I must admit  
十個月的沉澱，我必須說  
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it  
一切都放下，不代表不再掛念  
Ten months older I won't give in  
十個月的成長，我不再屈服  
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it  
我已經放下，我不想再賭注一切  
Finally clean, think I'm finally clean, ah ah  
我想我終於清澈透明，那些傷口終將弭平  
Think I'm finally clean  
我想我終於清澈透明

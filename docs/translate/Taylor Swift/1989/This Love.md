## 翻譯
Clear blue water

清澈湛藍的海水

High tide, came and brought you in

風颳起浪潮，把你擱淺在我的海岸

And I could go on and on, on and on

而我在海邊聽著海水的聲音

And I will, skies grow darker, currents swept you out again

而風起浪湧，水又將你帶走

And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

而你載浮載沉，消失在海面

In silent screams, and wildest dreams

低聲的呼嘯，奔放的想像

I never dreamed of this

這一切前所未見

This love is good

這愛甜美

This love is bad

這愛酸苦

This love is a life back from the dead, oh

這愛從灰燼中復燃

These hands had to let it go free

這愛必須得放手

And this love came back to me, oh

因為愛終回到我身邊

Oh, oh

Tossing, turning, struggle through the night for someone new

顫抖著，緩慢得，找尋新的歸宿

And I could go on and on, on and on

而我不斷前進

Lanterns burning, flickered in the mind only you

在腦海燭光閃爍，圍繞的都是你

But you were still gone, gone, gone

但你已隨大海離去

Been losing grip, on sinking ships

大海沉舟，沒了船槳

You showed up, just in time

你即時出現在我身邊

This love is good

這愛甜美

This love is bad

這愛酸苦

This love is a life back from the dead, oh

這愛從灰燼中復燃

These hands had to let it go free

這愛必須得放手

And this love came back to me, oh

因為愛終回到我身邊

This love left a permanent mark

這愛留下永恆的印記

This love is glowing in the dark, oh

這愛從黑暗中閃耀

These hands had to let it go free

這愛必須得放手

And this love came back to me, oh

因為愛終回到我身邊

This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)

這款愛，這款愛，這款愛

This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)

This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)

This love, this love, this love, this love

Your kiss, my cheek

在我的臉頰，留下一吻

I watched you leave

我看著你離開

Your smile, my ghost

你的笑，我的靈魂

I fell to my knees

我雙膝跪地

When you're young, just to run

你年輕時，出門闖蕩

But you come back to what you need

但你最終返航尋找你的摯愛

This love is good

這愛甜美

This love is bad

這愛酸苦

This love is a life back from the dead, oh

這愛從灰燼中復燃

These hands had to let it go free

這愛必須得放手

And this love came back to me, oh

因為愛終回到我身邊

This love left a permanent mark

這愛留下永恆的印記

This love is glowing in the dark, oh

這愛從黑暗中閃耀

These hands had to let it go free

這愛必須得放手

And this love came back to me, oh

因為愛終回到我身邊

This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)

這款愛

This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)

這款愛

This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)

這款愛

This love, this love, this love, this love

這款愛

(This love came back to me, oh)

這愛最終回到我身邊

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]  
Gray November    
灰天的11月  
I've been down since July  
我從7月就覺得烏雲不散了  
Motion capture  
慢動作的高速連拍  
Put me in a bad light  
將我置身在一團閃光燈前  
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone  
我回放我走的每一步  
Trying to find the one where I went wrong  
想知道我哪邊走錯  
Writing letters  
提筆寫信  
Addressed to the fire  
寄往火焰燒成灰燼  
  
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]  
And I was catchin' my breath  
我屏住呼吸  
Starin' out an open window, catchin' my death  
注視著窗外，追趕著我已逝的靈魂  
And I couldn't be sure  
我隱約覺得  
I had a feeling so peculiar  
一種特殊的感受油然升起  
That this pain would be for  
這份疼痛  
Evermore  
將會恆久

Hey, December  
嘿，十二月到來  
Guess I'm feeling unmoored  
我覺得我飄離岸邊了  
Can't remember  
我無法憶起  
What I used to fight for  
我當為何而戰?  
I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause  
我回放錄影帶，但每一幀都只有暫停  
On thе very moment all was lost  
所有的記憶都丟失了  
Sending signals  
發送訊號  
To be double-crossed  
卻換得背叛  
  
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]  
And I was catchin' my breath  
我屏住呼吸  
Starin' out an open window, catchin' my death  
注視著窗外，追趕著我已逝的靈魂  
And I couldn't be sure  
我隱約覺得  
I had a feeling so peculiar

[Post-Chorus: Justin Vernon]  
(Evermore)  
  
[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]  
Can't not think of all the cost  
沒辦法去想像那些代價  
And the things that will be lost  
沒辦法去估量那些要失去的東西  
Oh, can we just get a pause?  
我們能夠按下暫停鍵嗎?  
To be certain we'll be tall again  
即便嚴冬將生機凍結  
Whether weather be the frost  
我們一定會重新發芽的  
Or the violence of the dog days   
在酷暑下的暴力曝曬  
I'm on waves, out being tossed  
我在巨浪上顛簸，被掀起又摔下  
Is there a line that I could just go cross?  
當我的小船劇烈擺盪?  
And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost now)  
有沒有一條航線能讓我安全穿越? (無法想像這些代價 )  
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)  
我想到你 (所有的一切將消逝)  
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)  
在閃光燈的間隙 ( 我們能夠按下暫停嗎 ? )  
I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again)  
我夢到你 ( 我們一定能捲土重來的 )  
(If you think of all the cost)  
若你想到所有代價  
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)  
這場夢是真實嗎? ( 即便嚴冬來襲 )  
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)  
能夠搭橋使我穿越? ( 即便酷暑炎夏 )  
(Or the violence of the dog days)  
在酷暑下的暴力曝曬  
(Out on waves, being tossed)  
在巨浪上顛簸，被掀起又摔下  
(I'm on waves, out being tossed)  
我在巨浪上顛簸，被掀起又摔下  
But I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)  
但我肯定 ( 使否有一條路能夠讓我們安全穿越? )  
You were there  
你真實的在那場夢裡  
  
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]  
And I was catchin' my breath  
我屏住呼吸  
Floors of a cabin creakin' under my step  
腳下的木板滋滋作響  
And I couldn't be sure  
我隱約覺得  
I had a feeling so peculiar  
我心中有一種奇妙感受油然升起  
This pain wouldn't be for  
這場痛苦  
Evermore  
不會永遠持續  
  
[Outro: Taylor Swift, Justin Vernon, Both]  
Evermore (Evermore)  
Evermore (Evermore)  
This pain wouldn't be for evermore  
這場痛苦  
Evermore  
不會永遠持續

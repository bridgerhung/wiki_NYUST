[Verse 1]  
I'd never gone with the wind, just let it flow  
我未任隨著風流逝，僅是讓它輕輕拂過  
Let it take me where it wants to go  
讓我跟隨風的方向  
'Til you open the door, there's so much more  
直到你打開那扇門，我才知道  
I'd never seen it before  
世上有許多事物我尚未領略  
I was tryin' to fly but I couldn't find wings  
我嘗試翱翔，但找不到翅膀  
But you came along and you changed everything  
但你走向我，並改變了我的世界  
  
[Chorus]  
You lift my feet off the ground  
你像童話般公主抱起我  
You spin me around  
隨著你天旋地轉  
You make me crazier, crazier  
讓我為你著迷  
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes  
感覺我掉入名為你的漩渦，迷失在你的眼眸  
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier  
你讓我為你著迷，為你瘋狂。  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've watched from a distance as you made life your own  
我看著你所創造的世界  
Every sky was your own kind of blue  
這整片天空是屬於你的藍  
And I wanted to know how that would feel  
我也好想擁有你的感受  
And you made it so real  
而你讓一切豁然開朗，清晰可見  
You showed me somethin' that I couldn't see  
你讓我體會我視野所不能及  
You opened my eyes  
開闊了我的世界  
And you made me believe  
讓我相信了美好  
  
[Chorus]  
You lift my feet off the ground  
你像童話般公主抱起我  
You spin me around  
隨著你天旋地轉  
You make me crazier, crazier  
讓我為你著迷  
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes  
感覺我掉入名為你的漩渦，迷失在你的眼眸  
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier  
你讓我為你著迷，為你瘋狂。  
  
[Bridge]  
Baby, you showed me what livin' is for  
寶貝，你讓我找到生活的意義  
I don't wanna hide anymore  
我再也不想躲藏  
Oh-oh  
  
[Chorus]  
You lift my feet off the ground  
你像童話般公主抱起我  
You spin me around  
隨著你天旋地轉  
You make me crazier, crazier  
讓我為你著迷  
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes  
感覺我掉入名為你的漩渦，迷失在你的眼眸  
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier  
你讓我為你著迷，為你瘋狂。  
crazier, crazier　Crazier, crazier  
為你瘋狂，為你著迷

## 翻譯
[Verse 1]  
It wasn't just like a movie  
這不是一場電影  
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin  
這場噢，並沒有浸過我的衣服，滲進我的皮膚  
I'm drivin' away and I, I guess you could say  
我駕車駛離，但我想說  
This is the last time I'll drive this way again  
但這是我最後一次，我走這條路了。  
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray  
我的生活迷失在灰色，磨破我的手，嘗試去抓住甚麼。  
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't  
因為，我愛你，但是我必須離開  
  
[Chorus]  
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side  
再見了，我曾認為，站在我身邊的一切。  
Bye bye, baby  
再見了，寶貝  
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing  
我好愛你，但一切都成了一場空  
And all I have is your sympathy  
但我只剩下你的同情  
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me  
你帶了我回家，但你無法留下我  
Bye bye, baby  
再見了，寶貝  
Bye bye, baby  
永別了，寶貝  
  
[Verse 2]  
The picture frame is empty  
擺在桌上的，是沒有相片的相框  
On the dresser, vacant just like me  
我就像是沒人用的梳妝台  
I see your writing on the dash  
我看到你在儀表板上寫字  
Then back to your hesitation  
閃回你的回眸  
I was so sure of everything  
我確定一件事  
Everything I thought we'd always have  
我們曾有過的一切，是真實不虛的  
Guess I never doubted it  
我猜，我曾未懷疑過  
Then the here and the now floods in  
但現在我的生活洪水灌入  
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past  
沖刷並帶走我，使我成為你的過去  
  
[Chorus]  
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side  
再見了，我曾認為，站在我身邊的一切。  
Bye bye, baby  
再見了，寶貝  
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing

And all I have is your sympathy  
但我只剩下你的同情  
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me  
你帶了我回家，但你無法留下我  
Bye bye, baby  
再見了，寶貝  
Bye bye, baby  
永別了，寶貝   
  
[Bridge]  
And there's so much that I can't touch  
有好多事物，我無法觸及  
You're all I want but it's not enough this time  
你是我的想妄，但此時此刻，已經難以挽回  
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands  
我們共筆的日記，一頁頁的從我手中滑落  
And I'm so scared of how this ends  
我好害怕，我們走向的結局  
  
[Chorus]  
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side  
再見了，我曾認為，站在我身邊的一切。  
Bye bye, baby  
再見了，寶貝  
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing

And all I have is your sympathy  
但我只剩下你的同情

你帶了我回家，但你無法留下我

Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me

Bye bye, baby

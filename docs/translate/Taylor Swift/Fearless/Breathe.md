[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]

I see your face in my mind as I drive away

當我離開前，你的臉還映在腦海裡

'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way

因為我們倆都沒想到一切就這麼結束了

People are people and sometimes we change our minds

人們總是變化莫測

But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

但看著你離開的背影總是讓我痛心

[Break: Taylor Swift]

Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm

Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]

The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie

音樂響起像傷心電影的片尾曲

It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see

是你永遠不想看到的傷心結局

'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down

因為巨石崩落，我們被緊緊的壓在地板上

Now I don't know what to be without you around

我不知道沒了你我該如何是好

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]

And we know it's never simple, never easy

我們都知道感情一切都不容易，不簡單

Never a clean break, no one here to save me

我的心依然還有你，但沒有人來陪我度過這一切

You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

你是我的支柱，我們倆手上常畫的那個愛心

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to

沒有了你我無法呼吸，但我必須

Breathe without you, but I have to

深吸一口氣，沒了你，我依然得前進

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt

不想看到這場面，不想看到你受傷

Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve

每看到我們的感情有稍稍的跛腳，我就調頭不前進

But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out

世間上有些事情就是無法轉圜

And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout

似乎已經沒有救命的繩子，停止我們墜落

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]

And we know it's never simple, never easy

我知道這不容易，一切都不簡單

Never a clean break, no one here to save me

我的心依然還有你，但沒有人來陪我度過這一切

You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

你是我的支柱，我們倆手上常畫的那個愛心

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to

沒有了你我無法呼吸，但我必須

Breathe without you, but I have to

深吸一口氣，沒了你，我依然得前進

[Bridge: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]

It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend

半夜2點多，就像失去了一個摯友

Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me

希望你可以理解這對我來說，很痛苦難熬

It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend

半夜2點多，就像失去了一個摯友

Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

希望你可以理解這對我來說，很痛苦難熬

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]

And we know it's never simple, never easy

我知道這不容易，一切都不簡單

Never a clean break, no one here to save me

我的心依然還有你，但沒有人來陪我度過這一切

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]

I can't breathe without you, but I have to

沒有了你我無法呼吸，但我必須

Breathe without you, but I have to

深吸一口氣，沒了你，我依然得前進

Breathe without you, but I have to

吸一口氣，沒了你，我依然得前進

Breathe without you, but I have to

吸一口氣，沒了你，我依然得前進

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat]

I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)

對不起

I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry

對不起

I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Ooh, ooh)

對不起，必須離開你

I'm sorry

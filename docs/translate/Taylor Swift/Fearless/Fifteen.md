[Verse 1]

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors

你深吸一口氣，然後走進那扇大門

It's the morning of your very first day

今天是上高中的第一天

You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while

你和許久未見的朋友們打招呼

Try and stay out of everybody's way

盡量讓事情別出什麼差錯

It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here

這是新鮮人的新一年，你會在這個城鎮

For the next four years in this town

待上四年

Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say

幻想著這裡有個男生能夠對妳拋媚眼

"You know, I haven't seen you around before."

欸，女孩妳真美，

[Chorus]

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you

當你15歲時，有一個男孩說，他喜歡你

You're gonna believe them

你就相信他呢

And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out

而15歲的你一切都顯得手足無措

Well, count to ten, take it in

但是，閉著眼，數到十

This is life before you know who you're gonna be

Fifteen

但這就是15歲，在未知中探索的樣子

[Verse 2]

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail

你坐在班上，做你旁邊的男孩叫阿比蓋爾

And soon enough you're best friends

而很快你們就成為好朋友

Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool

嘲笑那些自以為很酷的女孩

We'll be outta here as soon as we can

然後在一溜煙的跑開

And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car

你很快的迎來你第一個約會，開著車來迎接你

And you're feeling like flying

你開心的往上飛

And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one

你媽媽站在門外等著你，而你沉溺在粉紅泡泡覺得他是真命天子

And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends

你們在自己的世界愉快的跳著舞

When the night ends

直到萬籟俱寂...

[Chorus]

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you

當你15歲時，有一個男孩說，他喜歡你

You're gonna believe them

你就相信他呢

And when you're fifteen and your first kiss

而你獻出15歲的第一個吻

Makes your head spin 'round

而開心的轉圈圈

But in your life you'll do things greater than

但你會做出比，

Dating the boy on the football team

和足球隊的年輕小伙約會還更棒的事

But I didn't know it at fifteen

但一切未發生，我們都不知道

[Bridge]

When all you wanted was to be wanted

當你總是想著，你想要有被需要的感覺

Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

希望能夠回到過去告訴自己

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday

那個被愛沖昏頭嚷著要嫁給他的自己

But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

但我現在懷著更大的夢想

And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy

而妳給了他你擁有的一切

Who changed his mind and we both cried

而那個變心的男孩，讓我們都哭了

[Chorus]

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you

當你15歲時，有一個男孩說，他喜歡你

You're gonna believe them

你就相信他呢

And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall

當你15歲時，千萬要記得腳下踩的路

I've found time can heal most anything

因為我知道了，時間可以治癒一切

And you just might find who you're supposed to be

而妳就會知道你心裡的定位

I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

當我15歲時，我也不知道我該駛向何處

[Post-Chorus]

La la la la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la la la la

La la la la la la

[Outro]

Your very first day

妳的開學第一天

Take a deep breath, girl

深吸一口氣，女孩

Take a deep breath, as you walk through the doors

深吸一口氣，然後踏出那一步.

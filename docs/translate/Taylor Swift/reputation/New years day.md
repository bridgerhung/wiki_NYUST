## 翻譯  
  

[Verse 1]  
There's glitter on the floor after the party  
閃亮的裝飾品落在派對後的地板  
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby  
女孩們在玄關內穿鞋  
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor  
融化的蠟燭和拍立得散落在木製地板  
You and me from the night before, but  
午夜的狂歡，似乎激情未散  
  
[Chorus]  
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you’re turning away  
當你迷路時，我在；但我害怕你轉身離開  
I want your midnights  
我想要和你共度午夜  
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day  
我會和你一起收拾狂歡後的酒杯  
  
[Verse 2]  
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi  
在計程車上，你隨著心跳握了我的手三次。  
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road  
我知道這是條漫長的道路  
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe  
當你發光發熱時我會在你身旁  
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home  
若你不幸出局，我也會在家陪伴你  
  
[Chorus]  
Don’t read the last page  
別翻到故事的最後一頁  
But I stay when it’s hard or it’s wrong or we're making mistakes  
即便我們遭遇困難，犯錯，我依然會留下  
I want your midnights  
我想要和你共度午夜  
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day  
我會和你一起收拾狂歡後的酒杯  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you  
請為回憶駐足，回憶也會等待你  
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you  
請為回憶駐足，回憶也會等待你  
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you  
請為回憶駐足，回憶也會等待你  
And I will hold on to you  
我也會等著你  
  
[Bridge]  
Please, don't ever become a stranger  
請別變成我去到任何城市，  
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere  
都認得出笑容的陌生人  
Please, don't ever become a stranger  
請別變成我走到任何街道，  
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere  
都認得出臉龐的陌生人  
  
[Verse 3]  
There's glitter on the floor after the party  
閃亮的裝飾品落在派對後的地板  
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby  
女孩們在玄關內穿鞋  
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor  
融化的蠟燭和拍立得散落在木製地板  
You and me forevermore  
我們會長長久久  
  
[Chorus]  
Don’t read the last page

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you

And I will hold on to you

[Outro]  
Please, don't ever become a stranger

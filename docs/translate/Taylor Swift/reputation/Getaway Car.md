[Intro]  
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car  
目的地為逃亡的奔馳，總沒好事發生  
  
[Verse 1]  
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes  
我們在最棒的相遇，做著最糟糕的勾當  
I struck a match and blew your mind  
我划了根火柴，點燃你激情的心  
But I didn't mean it and you didn’t see it  
我無意如此，你卻覺得有挑逗的意思  
The ties were black, the lies were white  
那黑領帶看著多斯文，那謊言聽著就有多蒼白  
In shades of gray in candlelight  
燭光燃起周圍的灰色陰影  
I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason  
我想離開，但我需要個理由  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart  
畫叉的地方，是我們摔車的標記  
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself  
他滿口甜言蜜語，而我沉浸在那花言巧語  
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed  
我打從第一杯酒就知道，我們被詛咒了  
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)  
這段情永遠不會開花結果  
  
[Chorus]  
You were drivin' the getaway car  
我們駕車通往逃亡  
We were flyin’, but we'd never get far  
我們在高空飛行，但永遠飛不遙遠  
Don't pretend it's such a mystery  
不要假裝這是愛的謎題  
Think about the place where you first met me  
想一想我們初遇的地方吧  
Ridin' in a getaway car  
在逃亡的車上奔馳  
There were sirens in the beat of your heart  
你的心跳夾著空襲警報  
Should've known I'd be the first to leave  
我當時應該先離開的  
Think about the place where you first met me  
想一想我們初遇的地方吧  
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh  
在逃亡的車上奔馳  
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ah  
永遠逃不遠  
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car  
目的地為逃亡的奔馳，總沒好事發生  
  
[Verse 2]  
It was the great escape, the prison break  
這是個偉大的破獄逃亡行動  
The light of freedom on my face  
自由的陽光在我臉上  
But you weren't thinkin’ and I was just drinkin’  
但我當時腦袋空白，喝酒消愁  
While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin’, "Go, go, go!"  
他那時追著我，我大喊著，快逃!!  
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow  
但寶貝，這是我們三人的餘興表演節目  
And a circus ain't a love story and now we're both sorry  
但八點檔的連續劇並不是真的愛情故事，現在我們都心懷愧疚  
(We’re both sorry)  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart  
畫叉的地方，是我們摔車的標記  
He poisoned the well, every man for himself  
他自己沉浸在那粉紅泡沫  
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed  
我打從第一杯酒就知道，我們被詛咒了  
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh!)  
這一發子彈射中你的心。  
  
[Chorus]  
You were drivin' the getaway car  
我們駕車通往逃亡  
We were flyin’, but we'd never get far  
我們在高空飛行，但永遠飛不遙遠  
Don't pretend it's such a mystery

[Bridge]  
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)  
我們曾是天生一對，鴛鴦大盜  
Until I switched to the other side, to the other side  
直到我像個牆頭草，切換陣營  
It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)  
我背叛了你一點都不意外  
'Cause us traitors never win  
因為叛徒們從來都不是贏家    
  
[Breakdown]  
I'm in a getaway car  
我在駛向逃亡的車輛  
I left you in a motel bar  
我把你留在飯店的酒吧  
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys  
偷走了錢，幹走了鑰匙  
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh!)  
那是你最後一次看到我  
  
[Chorus]  
Drivin' the getaway car

We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)

I was cryin' in a getaway car  
我手握方向盤哭泣  
I was dyin' in a getaway car  
在車上痛不欲生  
Said goodbye in a getaway car  
在我們相遇的逃亡車說再見吧

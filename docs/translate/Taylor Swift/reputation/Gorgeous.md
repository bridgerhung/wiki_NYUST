## 翻譯
[Verse 1]

You should take it as a compliment

你該把那當作我對你的稱讚

That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk

酒醉時拿著你的口音開玩笑

You should think about the consequence

你滿溢的魅力，強大的磁性

Of your magnetic field being a little too strong

該想想這會有什麼後果

And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us

我有一介男友，比我倆都年長

He's in the club doing, I don't know what

他在夜店不知道幹著什麼

You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)

你真是太迷人，害我不知道該說什麼

真是又愛又恨

[Pre-Chorus 1]

Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine

威士忌晶透的冰，透進葉脈的晚霞

You've ruined my life, by not being mine

你闖進我的生活，讓我情不自禁

[Chorus]

You're so gorgeous

你如此帥氣

I can't say anything to your face

看著你的臉我無可挑剔

'Cause look at your face

就是帥氣的你

And I'm so furious

看著你，我小鹿亂撞

At you for making me feel this way

你怎讓我對你心花怒放

But, what can I say?

但我能說什麼？

You're gorgeous

你就是如此美麗

[Verse 3]

You should take it as a compliment

你該把那當作我對你的稱讚

That I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you)

當我故意不和你說話

And you should think about the consequence

你該想想，暗室中觸摸我手的後果

Of you touching my hand in the darkened room (dark room, dark room)

在暗室中輕觸我的手

If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her

我會滿肚子醋，如果你有女友

But if you're single that's honestly worse

如果你單身，那就更加可惜了

'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts

(Honey, it hurts)

你是如此美麗，得不到讓我心如針扎

[Pre-Chorus 2]

Ocean blue eyes looking in mine

你眼中的湛藍，透進我的雙眼

I feel like I might sink and drown and die

我好似在海中沉淪，沉溺其中

[Chorus]

You're so gorgeous

你如此帥氣

I can't say anything to your face

看著你的臉我無可挑剔

'Cause look at your face

就是帥氣的你

And I'm so furious

看著你，我小鹿亂撞

At you for making me feel this way

你怎讓我對你心花怒放

But, what can I say?

但我能說什麼？

You're gorgeous

你就是如此美麗

[Bridge]

You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah

見到你讓我一飛沖天，卻又急轉直下

There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have

看不到卻得不到，是我的心頭之恨

You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad

你這麼帥氣，讓我又愛又恨

You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah

看見你讓我高興，悲傷卻猶然而起

There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have

沒有事情比得不到更討厭

Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats

我只能垂頭喪氣回家弄貓

Alone, unless you wanna come along, oh

孤身一人，除非我倆一起走

[Chorus]

You're so gorgeous

你如此帥氣

I can't say anything to your face

看著你的臉我無可挑剔

'Cause look at your face

就是帥氣的你

And I'm so furious

看著你，我小鹿亂撞

At you for making me feel this way

你怎讓我對你心花怒放

But, what can I say?

但我能說什麼？

You're gorgeous

你就是如此美麗

[Outro]

You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah

見到你讓我一飛沖天，卻又急轉直下

There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have

看不到卻得不到，是我的心頭之恨

You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad

你這麼帥氣，讓我又愛又恨

You're gorgeous

你就是這麼有魅力

這麼帥氣，讓我又愛又恨

You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah

看見你讓我高興，悲傷卻猶然而起

There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have

沒有事情比得不到更討厭

You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad

你如此帥氣，得不到讓我一肚子氣

You're gorgeous

你如此美麗

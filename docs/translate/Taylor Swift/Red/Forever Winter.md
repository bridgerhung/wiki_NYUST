[Verse 1]

He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days

他說：「我不相信任何言語」

He says, "Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?"

他說：「為何戀愛，經歷戀情消逝的痛苦」

He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be

他度過的每個夜晚，都可求一切完好如初

He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity

他往上飛，但總是因為地心引力摔落

[Pre-Chorus]

I call, just checking up on him

我打電話確認他

He's up, 3 AM, pacing

他醒著，半夜三點來回踱步

He says, "It's not just a phase I'm in"

他說，這不該是現在的我

My voice comes out begging

我向上天祈求

[Chorus]

All this time I didn't know

一直以來我都不知道

You were breaking down

你天人交戰

I'd fall to pieces on the floor

若你不在

If you weren't around

我也會因此碎裂

Too young to know it gets better

那時太年輕，不知道一切都會好起來

I'll be summer sun for you forever

我會成為你的太陽

Forever winter if you go

若你離開，一切將成為無盡寒冬

[Verse 2]

He seems fine most of the time

他看起來一切都還好

Forcing smiles and never minds

看似無害的，強迫擠出笑容

His laugh is a symphony

他的笑聲好似交響樂

When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe

當光明來去，一定讓你窒息

I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head

我嘗試將理清一絲一縷，將你腦中的空缺拼湊起來

Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead

我活在妳離開的恐懼中

[Pre-Chorus]

I call, just checking up on him

我打電話確認他

He's up, 5 AM, wasted

他醒著，清晨5點，醉茫茫

Long gone, not even listening

沒了魂魄，話語在他腦中離散

My voice comes out screaming

我哭著嘶吼

[Chorus]

All this time I didn't know

一直以來我都不知道

You were breaking down

你天人交戰

I'd fall to pieces on the floor

若你不在

If you weren't around

我也會因此碎裂

Too young to know it gets better

那時太年輕，不知道一切都會好起來

I'll be summer sun for you forever

我會成為你的太陽

Forever winter if you go

若你離開，一切將成為無盡寒冬

[Bridge]

If I was standing there in your apartment

如果我當時在你的家面前

I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it

我會拆除你腦中的炸彈

I'd say I love you even at your darkest and

即使在你最黑暗的時候，我都會愛你

Please don't go

請不要離開

[Chorus]

I didn't know

一直以來我都不知道

You were breaking down

你天人交戰

I'd fall to pieces on the floor

若你不在

If you weren't around

我也會因此碎裂

Too young to know it gets better

那時太年輕，不知道一切都會好起來

I'll be summer sun for you forever

我會成為你的太陽

Forever winter if you go

若你離開，一切將成為無盡寒冬

[Post-Chorus]

I'll be your summer sun forever

我會成為你一生的太陽

At 3 AM, pacing

3 點鐘，來回踱步

All this time I didn't know

一直以來我都不知道

At 5 AM, wasted

5點鐘，醉茫茫

I'd be in pieces on the floor

我因此碎裂

Forever winter if you go

你離開將成為無盡的冬天

[Outro]

He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days.

他說：「我甚麼都不信」

I say, "Believe in one thing, I won't go away"

我說：「請相信，我會陪著你」

## 翻譯
[Verse 1]

I was reminiscing just the other day  
我在回憶好久以前的一天  
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away  
獨自喝著咖啡，但是什麼抓住了我的目光  
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time  
在五光十色的紐約，回到第一眼的心動感受  
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme  
邂逅像的完美的押韻，妝點我的詩  
Took off faster than a green light, go  
俠著青風快速走過  
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know  
嘿，等你驀然回首，你才發現你剛好錯過  
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made  
And that was the first day  
我留著一句笑話貼在門上  
這是我們的第一天  

[Chorus]  
And darling, it was good  
達令，曾經，很美好  
Never looking down  
請停留在這一切  
And right there where we stood  
我們佇立的土地  
Was holy ground  
是神聖之地

[Verse 2]  
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress  
穿著新洋裝，像女孩一樣可愛旋轉  
We had this big wide city all to ourselves  
在這城市，大的只容的下我倆人  
We blocked the noise with the sound of, "I need you"  
彼此都屏蔽 “我需要你” 的聲音  
And for the first time, I had something to lose  
而最後的最初，我失去了某樣東西  
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way  
我想，我們像花朵一般謝落  
And the story's got dust on every page  
篇篇回憶都沾染上散落的塵土  
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now  
但，我時常想，你現在怎麼想呢?  
And I see your face in every crowd  
而我人海中總是看到你的臉龐  

[Chorus]  
And darling, it was good  
達令，曾經，很美好  
Never looking down  
請滯留在這一切  
And right there where we stood  
我們佇立的土地  
Was holy ground  
是神聖之地  

[Hook]  
Tonight, I'm gonna dance  
今晚，我要起身跳舞  
For all that we've been through  
致敬那曾經的一切  
But I don't wanna dance  
但我現在不想跳舞  
If I'm not dancing with you  
因為你沒在身邊和我共舞  
Tonight, I'm gonna dance  
今晚，我要起身跳舞  
Like you were in this room  
就好似你身在這個屋子裡  
But I don't wanna dance  
但我又不想跳舞  
If I'm not dancing with you  
因為你沒在身邊和我共舞  
  
[Chorus]  
It was good  
曾經，很美好  
Never looking down  
請滯留在這一切  
And right there where we stood  
我們佇立的土地  
Was holy ground  
是神聖之地  
  
[Outro]  
Tonight, I'm gonna dance  
今晚，我要起身跳舞  
For all that we've been through  
洗滌那曾經的一切  
But I don't wanna dance  
但我現在不想跳舞  
If I'm not dancing with you  
因為你沒在身邊和我共舞  
Tonight, I'm gonna dance  
今晚，我要起身跳舞  
Like you were in this room  
就好似你身在這個屋子裡  
But I don't wanna dance  
但我又不想跳舞  
If I'm not dancing with you  
因為你沒在身邊和我共舞

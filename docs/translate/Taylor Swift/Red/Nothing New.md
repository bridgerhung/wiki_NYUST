[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]  
They tell you while you're young  
他們在年輕時告訴妳  
"Girls, go out and have your fun"  
女孩，出去玩的開心吧  
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it  
然而他們去抓捕那些真的這麼做的人  
Criticize the way you fly  
批判妳在天上  
When you're soaring through the sky  
自由自在飛翔的樣子  
Shoot you down and then they sigh  
把妳擊落，然後嘆息  
And say, "She looks like she's been through it"  
她看起來已經失去純真了  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]  
Lord, what will become of me  
老天，如果不再有新鮮感  
Once I've lost my novelty?  
世界會變成什麼樣子?  
  
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]  
I've had too much to drink tonight  
今晚我喝了太多酒了  
And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about  
這說來令人難過，但我就是這麼想的  
And I wake up in the middle of the night  
我在午夜起身  
It's like I can feel time moving  
感受每分每秒的流動  
How can a person know everythin' at eighteen  
怎麼可能一個人18歲無所不知  
But nothin' at twenty-two?  
但是22歲卻一無所知?  
And will you still want me  
當我了無新意，  
When I'm nothing new?  
你會不會扭頭就走?  
  
[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]  
How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?  
什麼時候哭泣，不再討人可愛  
When you can't blame it on my youth  
沒有辦法再把我當成小孩看待  
And roll your eyes with affection  
然後用放大鏡轉動目光來看我  
And my cheeks are growing tired  
我臉上不再時刻掛著酒窩  
From turning red and faking smiles  
成熟的紅唇和假惺惺的笑容  
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?  
難道我們只是在等待鎂光燈不再照耀我的那一刻嗎?  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Phoebe Bridgers]  
And someone else lights up the room (Ah)  
新星冉冉升起  
People love an ingénue (Ah)  
人們都愛新商品新女孩  
  
[Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers, Taylor Swift]  
I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight  
今晚我喝太多酒了  
How did I go from growin' up to breaking down?  
為什麼我成長到走向毀滅  
And I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night  
我在午夜中醒來  
It's like I can feel time movin'  
感受時間流動  
How can a person know everything at eighteen  
怎麼可能一個人18歲無所不知  
But nothing at twenty-two?  
但是22歲卻一無所知?  
And will you still want me  
當我了無新意，  
When I'm nothing new?  
你是否還願意看我  
  
[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Both, Phoebe Bridgers]  
I know someday I'm gonna meet her, it's a fever dream  
我知道我有一天會遇見新人，這是個高興的夢魘  
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen  
她有著17歲少女獨有的光芒  
She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me  
她知道這條路怎麼走，她獲說從我上得到成功的地圖  
I'll say I'm happy for her, then I'll cry myself to sleep  
我會說，我真替妳高興，然後窩在被子裡哭泣  
Oh, woah, oh (Oh)  
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh (Oh)  
  
[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Phoebe Bridgers, Both]  
I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight  
今晚我喝了太多酒了  
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out  
我在想他們把我逐出城後還會不會想我  
I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night  
我在午夜醒來  
And I can feel time moving  
感受每分每秒的流動  
How can a person know everythin' at eighteen  
怎麼可能一個人18歲無所不知  
But nothin' at twenty-two?  
但是22歲卻一無所知?  
And will you still want me  
當我了無新意  
Will you still want me  
你是否還願意看我  
Will you still want me

When I'm nothing new?  
你是否還願意看我

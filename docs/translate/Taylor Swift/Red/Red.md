[Verse 1]

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati

愛著他就像駕著高貴的瑪莎拉蒂

Down a dead-end street

駛向遙遠的盡頭

Faster than the wind, passionate as sin

馳騁疾風，激情的美好像七原罪

Ending so suddenly

但結束的就像煞車般突然

Loving him is like trying to change your mind

愛著他總是會有全新的感受

Once you're already flying through the free fall

就好像望著在空中下落的遼闊

Like the colors in autumn, so bright

就像秋天的楓色，如此耀眼

Just before they lose it all

一切就好像秋落前的美好

[Chorus]

Losing him was blue like I'd never known

失去他就好像我從未見過的憂鬱藍

Missing him was dark grey, all alone

想念他就好像天空中的陰雨灰

Forgetting him was like

忘記他就好像

Trying to know somebody you never met

試著串改記憶中的那個他一樣的痛苦

But loving him was red

但愛著他就是火山爆發的紅色

Loving him was red

愛著他就是濃烈的紅色

[Verse 2]

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted

碰觸他就好像勾起生活中的一切慾望

Was right there in front of you

一切慾望都得到滿足

Memorizing him was as easy as knowing

憶起他就好像

All the words to your old favorite song

呼吸般的簡單

Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword

和他鬥嘴就好像填字謎一樣困難

And realizing there's no right answer

而且找不到解答

Regretting him was like wishing you never found out

使他後悔就好像你從來不知道希望

That love could be that strong

這愛從未如此濃烈

[Chorus]

Losing him was blue like I'd never known

失去他就好像我從未見過的憂鬱藍

Missing him was dark grey, all alone

想念他就好像天空中的陰雨灰

Forgetting him was like

忘記他就好像

Trying to know somebody you never met

試著串改記憶中的那個他一樣的痛苦

But loving him was red

但愛著他就是火山爆發的紅色

Oh, red

Burning red

愛的火光

[Bridge]

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes

想起他就像回聲在耳朵不斷回響

Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go

我告訴我自己我應該放手

But moving on from him is impossible

抽離這份愛似乎難如登天

When I still see it all in my head

因為在身邊還浮現你的影子

In burning red

火紅的顏色

Loving him was red

愛著他就像是濃烈的紅色

[Chorus]

Losing him was blue like I'd never known

失去他就好像我從未見過的憂鬱藍

Missing him was dark grey, all alone

想念他就好像天空中的陰雨灰

Forgetting him was like

忘記他就好像

Trying to know somebody you never met

試著串改記憶中的那個他一樣的痛苦

Cause, loving him was red

但愛著他就是火山爆發的紅色

Yeah, yeah, red

We're burning red

我們愛的熱烈

[Breakdown]

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head

這就是為什麼，他依舊在我的腦海裡揮之不去

Comes back to me, burning red

一切反彈到我，使我著火

Yeah, yeah

[Outro]

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati

愛著他就像駕著高貴的瑪莎拉蒂

Down a dead-end street

駛向死路的盡頭

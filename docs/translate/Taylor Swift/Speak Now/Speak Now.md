[Verse 1]  
I am not the kind of girl  
我不是那種  
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion  
在結婚的場合討價還價的那種女孩  
But you are not the kind of boy  
你也不是那種，  
Who should be marrying the wrong girl  
會娶錯女孩的男生  
I sneak in and see your friends  
我偷溜進會場，看到你的朋友們  
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel  
她那些 – 有錢家人們穿著粉色的禮服  
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid  
而她穿著像糕點的禮服  
Somewhere back inside a room  
在休息室裡  
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry  
對著伴娘大吼大叫  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
This is surely not what you thought it would be  
這絕對不是你想要的樣子  
I lose myself in a daydream  
我沉浸在自己的白日夢  
Where I stand and say  
我矗立在婚禮會場說：  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't say yes, run away now  
不要立下誓言，和我一起私奔吧  
I'll meet you when you're out  
我會在教堂外  
Of the church, at the back door  
的後門等著你!  
Don't wait or say a single vow  
不要許下任何誓言  
You need to hear me out  
請認真聽我說  
And they said, "Spеak now"  
而坐在台下的人催促著你說：我願意。  
  
[Verse 2]  
Fond gestures are еxchanged  
彼此交換了親切的手勢  
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march  
而風琴吹響的樂章宛如死亡進行曲  
And I am hiding in the curtains  
我躲在窗簾後面  
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be  
我看起來，沒被你可愛的準新娘邀請  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen  
她著裝像個選美王后，走向舞台  
But I know you wish it was me  
但我知道你希望那個人是我  
You wish it was me, don't you?  
難道不是嗎?  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't say yes, run away now  
不要立下誓言，和我一起私奔吧  
I'll meet you when you're out  
我會在教堂外  
Of the church, at the back door

And they said, "Spеak now"

Don't say yes, run away now  
不要立下誓言，和我一起私奔吧  
I'll meet you when you're out

Of the church, at the back door  
的後門等著你!  
Your time is running out  
你的時間快沒有了  
And they said, "Speak now"  
而坐在台下的人催促著你說：我願意。  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Ooh (Run away now), la  
Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh  
  
[Bridge]  
I hear the preacher say  
我聽到牧師說  
"Speak now or forever hold your peace"  
說出我願意吧，不然就永遠沉默  
There's the silence, there's my last chance  
你沉默了一會，喔，我的機會來了  
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me  
我站起來揮了揮手，所有人注視著我  
Horrified looks from everyone in the room  
所有人驚恐地看著我  
But I'm only lookin' at you  
但我是唯一看著你的人  
  
[Verse 3]  
I am not the kind of girl  
我不是那種  
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion  
在結婚的場合討價還價的那種女孩  
But you are not the kind of boy

Who should be marrying the wrong girl (haha)

So, don't say yes, run away now  
不要立下誓言，和我一起私奔吧  
I'll meet you when you're out

請認真聽我說  
They said, "Spеak now"  
而坐在台下的人催促著你說：我願意。  
And you say, "Let's run away now (Run away now)  
而你說，我們私奔吧  
I'll meet you when I'm ou  
我會脫下我的燕尾服，  
Of my tux, at the back door  
在外頭和你會面  
Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)  
寶貝，我沒許下承諾  
So glad you were around  
當台下的人催促著我說：我願意  
When they said, 'Speak now'  
我好高興那時妳在我身旁。

[Verse 1]

Your little hand's wrapped around my finger

你嬌小的手，與我的手十指交扣

And it's so quiet in the world tonight

萬籟俱寂

Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming

你的眼皮抖啊抖，在睡夢中

So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light

我抱緊你，

To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret

對你來說每件事都很美好，沉浸其中

I'd give all I have, honey

我會給你我的一切

If you could stay like that

只要你待在我身邊

[Chorus]

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up

喔親愛的，請你永遠不要長大

Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little

請你永遠不要長大，就這樣可愛

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up

喔親愛的，請你永遠不要長大

Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple

請你永遠不要長大，一切就會這樣單純

I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart

我不會讓誰傷害你，不會讓誰傷你的心

And no one will desert you

而沒有人配的上你

Just try to never grow up, never grow up

請你不要長大

[Verse 2]

You're in the car on the way to the movies

坐在車上，駛向電影院

And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off

而你因為媽媽載你來而臉紅

At 14 there's just so much you can't do

但你才14歲，很多事不能做

And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots

而你迫不及待要長大成人，自己做主

But don't make her drop you off around the block

Remember that she's getting older too

記著媽媽也會變老

And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

別忘了你穿著睡衣跳起了舞，準備到學校

[Chorus]

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up

喔，親愛的永遠別長大

Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little

請別長大，就維持這樣的可愛

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up

喔，親愛的，永遠不要長大

Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple

永遠別長大，事情就不會變複雜

No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred

沒有人會傷害你，也不會被火灼傷

And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

即使你想，但試著別長大

[Bridge]

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room

記著你的童年的樣子

Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home

記著每當你爸爸回來時，興奮的樣子

Remember the footsteps, remember the words said

記著那些步伐，記著那些話語

And all your little brother's favorite songs

還有你弟弟喜歡的那些歌曲

I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

我意識到所有小時候的一切，有一天會不見

So here I am in my new apartment

我在我新的家

In a big city, they just dropped me off

在這大城市，他們將我丟包

It's so much colder than I thought it would be

這一切比我想像中要冷

So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on

我蓋好被子，打開夜燈

Wish I'd never grown up

希望我不曾長大

I wish I'd never grown up

希望我不曾長大

[Chorus]

Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up

希望我不曾長大，希望我不要長大

I could still be little

我還可以逍遙自在

Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up

希望我不曾長大，希望我不要長大

It could still be simple

一切依舊簡單

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up

喔，親愛的，別長大

Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little

別長大，就處這樣年輕

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up

喔，親愛的別長大

Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple

不要長大，一切就會很簡單

Won't let nobody hurt you

別讓任何人傷害你

Won't let no one break your heart

別讓別人讓你心碎

And even though you want to, please try to never grow up

就算你想，也請你別長大

Oh, don't you ever grow up

請你不要長大

Oh, never grow up, just never grow up

請你不要長大

[Verse 1]

You're giving me a million reasons to let you go

你給了我千百萬理由，讓我放你走

You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show

你給了我千百萬理由，讓我放棄一切

You're givin' me a million reasons

你給了我一大堆理由

Give me a million reasons

你給了我一大堆理由

Givin' me a million reasons

你給了我一大堆理由

About a million reasons

一大堆理由

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills

若有高速公路，我將駛向山谷

If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still

若我能找到冷

But you're giving me a million reasons

但你給了我一大堆理由

Give me a million reasons

給了我一大堆理由

Givin' me a million reasons

給了我一大堆理由

About a million reasons

一大堆理由

[Chorus]

I bow down to pray

我跪下祈禱

I try to make the worst seem better

試著讓破碎的挽回

Lord, show me the way

主啊，照亮我前方的道路

To cut through all his worn out leather

將那破舊的衣結斬斷

I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away

我有了千百萬可以走的理由

But baby, I just need one good one to stay

但寶貝，我只是想有個歸宿

[Verse 2]

Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare

在循環中陷入焦灼，我別眼看向別處

It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware

好似我已經失去呼吸，但意識依舊清晰

'Cause you're giving me a million reasons

你給了我給了我一大堆理由

Give me a million reasons

給了我一大堆理由

Givin' me a million reasons

給了我一大堆理由

About a million reasons

一大堆理由

And if you say something that you might even mean

若你講了你心中的真實話語

It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe

很難了解哪部分才是真實

'Cause you're giving me a million reasons

因為你給了我一大堆理由

Give me a million reasons

給了我一大堆理由

Givin' me a million reasons

給了我一大堆理由

About a million reasons

一大堆理由

[Chorus]

I bow down to pray

我跪下祈禱

I try to make the worst seem better

我試著讓破碎的挽回

Lord, show me the way

主啊，照亮我前方的道路

To cut through all his worn out leather

將那破舊的衣結斬斷

I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away

我有了千百萬可以走的理由

But baby, I just need one good one to stay

但寶貝，我只是想有個歸宿

[Bridge]

Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy

Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'

我心正流淌著

Stay, ehh, ehhy

Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'

你難道不能給我，我所需要的

Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith

每一次心碎，都更難維繫信心

But baby, I just need one good one

我只是想有個歸宿

Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

歸宿，歸宿，歸宿

[Chorus]

When I bow down to pray

當我跪下祈禱

I try to make the worst seem better

我試著讓破碎的挽回

Lord, show me the way

主啊，照亮我前方的道路

To cut through all his worn out leather

將那破舊的衣結斬斷

I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away

我有了千百萬可以走的理由

But baby, I just need one good one to stay

但寶貝，我只是想有個歸宿

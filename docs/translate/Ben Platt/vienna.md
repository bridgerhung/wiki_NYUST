## 無論你花多長時間，愛與幸福(維也納)都終究會等著你

但前提是慢下來

> Vienna is a metaphor for the rest of your life. Joel is asking all the young and restless overachievers, “When will you be patient, and understand that the rest of your life can wait for you to achieve love and happiness?”

:::caution 這首歌想說

### 太用力會在人生的中途精疲力竭，意識到自己從來沒有抓住機會享受早年。保持高速，當你人生過半的時候，回頭看，意識到自己從來沒有停下來享受一切

## 翻譯
[Verse 1]  
Slow down, you crazy child  
慢點，你狂躁的孩子  
You're so ambitious for a juvenile  
你還未成年，野心太大了  
But then if you're so smart  
我想你很聰明  
Tell me why are you still so afraid, hmm?  
但告訴我你為甚麼依然害怕，恩?  
Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?  
是哪裡起火了? 那麼急幹甚麼?  
You'd better cool it off before you burn it out  
你得讓你自己降溫，以免讓自己燃燒殆盡  
You've got so much to do  
你有好多事情想做  
And only so many hours in a day, ayy  
但一天只有24小時不是嗎?  
  
[Chorus 1]  
But you know that when the truth is told  
你一直知道那個殘酷的真相  
That you can get what you want  
你要不得到你想要的  
Or you can just get old  
就是一事無成慢慢變老  
You're gonna  
你會  
Kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh  
只行到路途的一半，就已經精疲力竭  
When will you realize  
你何時意識到  
Vienna waits for you?  
維也納正等著你  
  
[Verse 2]  
Slow down, you're doin' fine  
慢下來，你做的一切都很好啊  
You can't be everything you wanna be  
在你到達屬於你的時刻前  
Before your time  
你沒辦法每件事都緊緊抓住  
Although it's so romantic  
況且，今晚的地平線  
On the borderline tonight, tonight  
依舊浪漫的閃著光芒  
Too bad but it's the life you lead  
讓你掌舵人生太浪費了  
You're so ahead of yourself  
你太衝得太前面了  
That you forgot what you need  
忘了自己需要甚麼  
Though you can see when you're wrong  
你看的到你犯下的錯  
You know you can't always see when you're right  
但總是看不到自己的好，自己的正確  
You're right  
看不到自己的好  
  
[Chorus 2]  
You've got your passion  
你有你的熱情  
You've got your pride  
你有你要取得的榮耀  
But don't you know  
但你難道不知道  
That only fools are satisfied?  
只有傻子才滿意嗎?  
Dream on  
繼續作夢吧  
But don't imagine they'll all come true, ooh  
但別想著夢都會成真  
When will you realize  
你何時意識到  
Vienna waits for you?  
維也納正等著你?  
  
[Instrumental break]  
  
[Chorus 3]  
Slow down, you crazy child  
慢下來吧，你這走火入魔的孩子  
And take the phone off the hook  
把電話關機  
And disappear for a while  
去消失休息一陣子吧  
It's all right, you can afford  
休息一會，沒關係的  
To lose a day or two, ooh  
你負擔的起一兩天的。  
When will you realize  
你何時意識到  
Vienna waits for you?  
維也納正等著你?  
  
[Chorus 1]  
But you know that when the truth is told  
你一直知道那個殘酷的真相  
That you can get what you want  
你要不得到你想要的  
Or you can just get old  
就是一事無成慢慢變老  
You're gonna  
你會  
Kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh  
只行到路途的一半，就已經精疲力竭  
When don't you realize  
你何時意識到  
Vienna waits for you?  
維也納正等著你?  
  
[Outro]  
When will you realize  
你何時才會意識到  
Vienna waits for you?  
維也納正等著你?

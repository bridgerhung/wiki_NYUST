[Verse 1]  
You say  
你說  
You've been through this before  
你以前經歷過痛苦  
You gave away all your secrets  
你向別人道出所有秘密  
To someone who up and left you in pieces  
最終那人背叛使你破碎  
I know the feeling, believe me  
相信我，我知道那個感覺  
I know the prices you've gotta pay  
我知道你曾付出甚麼代價  
I'm sacrificing my freedom  
我犧牲我的自由  
And all just to get somebody to see me  
只為了讓別人看到我  
Nobody said it was easy  
沒人說這一切很簡單  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
My heart's been broken and broken and broken and broken  
我的心曾支離破碎  
But I keep, keep on hopin' and hopin' and hopin' and hopin'  
但我讓我心中希望的火苗不熄滅  
That if it keeps on breakin' and breakin' and breakin' and breakin'  
若一切一直再度破碎  
Then one day it'll open and open and open and open and open for you  
那有一天破碎的，會成為一扇為你而開的窗口  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey  
I know we've both been afraid  
我知道我們都很害怕  
But we can't run from the wind and the thunder  
但我們在雨中盡情跳舞  
When we're dancing under the rain, the rain, the rain  
我們無法逃過颶風和閃電  
  
Hey  
I know we got what it takes  
我知道我們堅毅，能夠突破重圍  
Ain't gonna run from the wind and the thunder  
所以別逃離風暴和雷電吧  
When we're dancing under the rain, the rain, the rain  
我們在雨中盡情跳舞  
We're dancing under the rain  
我們在雨中盡情跳舞  
  
[Verse 2]  
Breathe deep, let it wash over you  
深吸氣，讓雨洗滌你  
We're slowly becoming lovers  
我們慢熱，成為戀人  
I promise you we won't be like the others  
我發誓我們將與眾不同  
We won't go running for cover  
我們將不會躲躲藏藏  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
My heart's been broken and broken and broken and broken  
我的心曾支離破碎  
But I keep, keep on hopin' and hopin' and hopin' and hopin'  
但我讓我心中希望的火苗不熄滅

若一切一直再度破碎  
Then one day it'll open and open and open and open and open for you  
那有一天破碎的，會成為一扇為你而開的窗口

I know we've both been afraid

We're dancing under the rain

But I keep, keep on hopin' and hopin' and hopin' and hopin'  
但懷抱著希望  
(Dancing under the rain)

若一切一直再度破碎  
Then one day it'll open and open and open and open and open for you  
那有一天破碎的，會成為一扇為你而開的窗口

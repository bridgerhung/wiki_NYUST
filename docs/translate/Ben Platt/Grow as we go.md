[Verse 1]  
You say there's so much you don’t know  
你說世間還有好多東西不懂  
You need to go and find yourself  
你想要離開，去找尋自己  
You say you'd rather be alone  
你說你比較想要獨自前行  
'Cause you think you won’t find it tied to someone else  
因為你覺得如果有束縛會找不到自己  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ooh, who said it's true  
喔，那是誰說的  
That the growing only happens on your own?  
誰說只能你獨自成長  
They don't know me and you  
他們不認識我和你  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't think you have to leave  
我不覺得你需要離開  
If to change is what you need  
若你覺得你需要改變  
You can change right next to me  
你可以讓改變在我身邊發生  
When you're high, I'll take the lows  
我可以調劑你的狀態，幫你平衡  
You can ebb and I can flow  
當你疲憊，我願成為你的臂彎  
And we'll take it slow  
而們可以慢慢前進  
And grow as we go  
攜手前行  
Grow as we go  
一起成長  
  
[Verse 2]  
You won't be the only one  
你不會唯一一個  
I am unfinished, I’ve got so much left to learn  
我也不是完人，我還有好多事物要學習  
I don’t know how this river runs  
我不知道這江水如何湧動  
But I'd like the company through every twist and turn  
但我希望我們兩個人一起度過波濤翻滾  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ooh, who said it's true

If to change is what you need  
若你覺得你需要改變  
You can change right next to me  
你可以讓改變在我身邊發生  
When you're high, I'll take the lows  
當你在高峰，我就在低谷  
You can ebb and I can flow  
當你潮退，我願是你的漲潮  
And we'll take it slow  
而們可以慢慢前進  
And grow as we go  
攜手前行  
Grow as we go  
一起成長  
Grow as we go  
Grow as we go  
  
[Bridge]  
I don't know who we'll become  
我不知道我們將走向何方  
I can't promise it's not written in the stars  
我不知道，未來的一切是否已寫在星運  
But I believe that when it's done  
但我相信，當我們成為完人  
We're gonna see that it was better  
我們回首過往，將見證一切  
That we grew up together  
我們的成長

Tell me you don't wanna leave

You can change right next to me  
請讓改變在我身旁發生  
When you're high, I'll take the lows

You can ebb and I can flow

And we'll take it slow

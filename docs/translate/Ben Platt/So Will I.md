[Verse 1]  
You say "What if I go crazy?"  
你說如果"我失去理智怎麼辦"  
I say "That ain't gonna happen"  
我說"那不會發生"  
You say "What if I get lost?"  
你說"我迷失了怎麼辦"  
I say "You'll just find your way back"  
我說"找到回家的路"  
And you say "What if someone breaks my heart?"  
而你說"如果有人讓你心碎"  
“I'll put it back together like I do”  
我說"我會把你的心縫補起來"  
You say "What if I don't catch the dreams  
That I've been out there chasing?  
如果我一直追尋的夢想，無法企及怎麼辦?  
What if when my fears show up  
如果我無法直面  
I'm too afraid to face them?"  
我心中的恐懼怎麼辦?  
Well, I can't fight your battles  
恩，我沒辦法過你的生活  
But I sure can hold your hand and promise you  
但我會陪你攜手度過難關  
  
[Chorus]  
That the sky will still be up there  
天不會塌下來  
And the sun will always shine  
陽光的熱力不會衰退  
The stars will keep on fallin'  
流星會不斷墜落  
For the ones who wish at night  
只要你願意許願  
The mountains won't start moving  
山不會移動  
And the rivers won't run dry  
河水不會流乾  
The world will always be there  
世界永遠存在  
And so will I  
我也會永遠陪伴著你  
(Will I, will I)  
(Will I, will I)  
[Verse 2]  
You say "What if things start changing?"  
你說"如果事情發生改變怎麼辦"  
I say "We'll be changing with ‘em  
我說，那我們就一起改變吧  
We'll just sing a different melody  
我們唱著不一樣的旋律  
And dance at different rhythm"  
跳著不一樣的舞  
You say "What if I give up?"  
你說，如果我放棄怎麼辦?  
I say "That's one thing that I'll never let you do"  
我說:我永遠不會讓你放棄  
You say "What if someone leaves me  
如果有人離開了我  
And they leave me empty-handed?"  
讓我失去一切  
I say "Losing only teaches you  
我說:失去讓你學到  
To not take things for granted  
被給予不是理所當然  
No, I can't just bring 'em back  
失去的不會再回來  
But darling, I can hold your hand and promise you"  
但達令，我可以握著你的手，然後向你保證  
  
[Chorus]  
That the sky will still be up there  
天不會塌  
And the sun will always shine  
陽光會不斷照耀  
The stars will keep on fallin'

For the ones who wish at night

The mountains won't start moving

And the rivers won't run dry

The world will always be there  
世界將永遠長在  
And so will I  
我也與你同在  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
(Will I, will I)  
(Will I, will I)  
So will I, I (Will I, will I)  
Oh, I (Will I, will I)  
And so will I (Will I, will I)  
我也與你同在  
I, oh, I (Will I, will I)  
I, and so will I (So will I, so will I)  
我也與你同在  
I (So will I, so will I)  
  
[Outro]  
Even if the sky is fallin'  
當 天塌下來  
And the sun don't want to shine  
太陽不再照耀  
If the stars we used to wish on  
當我們許願的星辰  
Disappear into the night  
都消失在夜晚的天空  
Well, I can move a mountain  
我願為了你  
But only by your side  
成為你的靠山  
Just say you'll always be there  
只要你願意與我同在  
I know you'll always be there  
我也深知你與我同在  
And so will I  
那我也與你同在

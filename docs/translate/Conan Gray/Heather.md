[Verse 1]

I still remember, third of December, me in your sweater

我依然記得，那一年的12月，我穿著你的毛衣

You said it looked better on me than it did you

你說，我穿起來比你更好看

Only if you knew, how much I liked you

只有你知道，我比任何人都喜歡你

But I watch your eyes as she

但我看著你的眼，她也一起

[Pre-Chorus]

Walks by

走過來

What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky

多麼心酸的景象，那比太陽還辣眼

She's got you mesmerized while I die

她讓你深深著迷，我也隨著沉淪

[Chorus]

Why would you ever kiss me?

你為何要吻我

I'm not even half as pretty

我不及她一半美麗

You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester

你給了他你的毛衣，聚酯纖維的那一件

But you like her better

但你愛他更甚

(Wish I were Heather)

我希望我是她

[Verse 2]

Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand

看著她與你相伴，牽著手

Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder

肩上搭著你的手臂，看著心好冷

But how could I hate her? She's such an angel

但我要如何恨他，她也是個天使

But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she

但還是忍不住，希望她不曾存在，正當她

[Pre-Chorus]

Walks by

走過來

What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky

多麼心酸的景象，那比太陽還辣眼

She's got you mesmerized while I die

她讓你深深著迷，我也隨著沉淪

￼

Chorus]

Why would you ever kiss me?

I'm not even half as pretty

You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester

你給了他你的毛衣，聚酯纖維的那一件

But you like her better

但你愛他更甚

(Wish I were Heather)

我希望我是她

[Bridge]

(Oh) Wish I were Heather

我希望我是希瑟

(Oh, oh) Wish I were Heather

我希望我是希瑟

Why would you ever kiss me?

Wish I were

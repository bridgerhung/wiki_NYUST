[Intro]

Wish you were so—, wish you were so—, wish you were sober

希望你是清醒的

Sober, sober, sober

清醒，冷靜

[Verse 1]

This party's shit, wish we could dip

這派對好爛，希望我們能離開

Go anywhere but here

哪裡都可以去，就是不要來這裡

Don't take a hit, don't kiss my lips

不要碰我，不要親我

And please don't drink more beer

然後別再把自己灌的爛醉

[Pre-Chorus]

I'ma crawl out the window now

我要從窗戶逃離現場

'Cause I don't like anyone around

這裡空氣中都是腐臭味

Kinda hope you're followin' me out

他希望你隨我一起出去

But this is definitely not my crowd

因為這裡並不是 我想要的地方

[Chorus]

Nineteen, but you act twenty-five now

19歲 但你的行為舉止像25

Knees weak, but you talk pretty fly, wow

雙腳發軟 但講話醉得天花亂墜

Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed

手握著剛喝完酒杯，穿著破掉的牛仔褲

Take me where the music ain't too loud

帶我到音樂沒這麼吵的地方

Trade drinks, but you don't even know her

喝了杯陌生女孩的飲料

Save me 'til the party is over

又在派對結束前救了我

Kiss me in the seat of your Rover

在你豪車的座位上吻了我

Real sweet, but I wish you were sober

很甜蜜，但我希望你是清醒的

[Post-Chorus]

(Wish you were so—, wish you were so—, wish you were sober)

I wish you were sober

我希望你是清醒的

(Wish you were so—, wish you were so—, wish you were sober)

I wish you were sober

我希望你是清醒的

[Verse 2]

Trip down the road, walking you home

步伐蹣跚， 攙扶著你回家

You kiss me at your door

又用醉爛的身體在門前吻了我

Pulling me close, beg me stay over

熊抱我央求，不要走

But I'm over this roller coaster

但我的心臟已經沒力了

[Pre-Chorus]

I'ma crawl out the window now

我得趕緊翻窗溜走

Getting good at saying, "Gotta bounce"

說著順口溜，不好意思先走了

Honestly, you always let me down

說實話你總是讓我失望

And I know we're not just hanging out

我也知道我們不僅僅是在一起

[Chorus]

Nineteen, but you act twenty-five now

19歲 但你的行為舉止像25

Knees weak, but you talk pretty fly, wow

雙腳發軟 但講話醉得天花亂墜

Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed

手握著剛喝完酒杯，穿著破掉的牛仔褲

Take me where the music ain't too loud

帶我到音樂沒這麼吵的地方

Trade drinks, but you don't even know her

喝了杯陌生女孩的飲料

Save me 'til the party is over

又在派對結束前救了我

Kiss me in the seat of your Rover

在你豪車的座位上吻了我

Real sweet, but I wish you were sober

很甜蜜，但我希望你是清醒的

[Post-Chorus]

(Wish you were so—, wish you were so—, wish you were sober)

I wish you were sober

我希望你是清醒的

(Wish you were so—, wish you were so—, wish you were sober)

I wish you were sober

我希望你是清醒的

[Bridge]

I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish

我希望，我希望，我希望，我希望

I wish you were sober

希望當初你是清醒的

I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish

我希望，我希望，我希望，我希望

Oh, I wish you were sober

希望當初你是清醒的

[Chorus]

Nineteen, but you act twenty-five now

19歲 但你的行為舉止像25

Knees weak, but you talk pretty fly, wow

雙腳發軟 但講話醉得天花亂墜

Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed

手握著剛喝完酒杯，穿著破掉的牛仔褲

Take me where the music ain't too loud

帶我到音樂沒這麼吵的地方

Trade drinks, but you don't even know her

喝了杯陌生女孩的飲料

Save me 'til the party is over

又在派對結束前救了我

Kiss me in the seat of your Rover

在你豪車的座位上吻了我

Real sweet, but I wish you were sober

很甜蜜，但我希望你是清醒的

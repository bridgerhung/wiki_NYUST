## 翻譯

[Verse 1]

She said, "Every time I close my eyes I feel like I could disappear

我每次壁上我的眼睛，我都覺得我要消失了

I could overflow an ocean with the cavalcade of all my tears

我留下的眼淚足以填滿大海

And I know I sound dramatic, but that's just how it feels"

我每次都好像演的很誇張，但就是這麼嚴重

She said, "I'm holdin' to the notion that I'll find something real"

我一直覺得我能抓住真正的東西

[Chorus]

Yeah, I just want to be wanted, oh

我只是想被想要

I could use a little love sometimes

可以付出我的一些小愛

I just need to be needed, oh

我只是想被需要

Like to know I'm crossin' someone's mind

就好比我在你的記憶中穿梭

I just want to be someone that somebody needs

我想要成為一個能被需要的人

I just want to be more than a drop in the sea

我不想只是一個被丟進海裡的石頭

I just want to be

我只是要這樣

[Verse 2]

She said, "I'm countin' up my karma and I think

我正清點著我犯過的錯

it's time to cash it in (Cash it in)

該是時間贖罪了

[So tired of livin' in a shadow of a mountain of what might've been](https://genius.com/Onerepublic-wanted-lyrics#note-16445821)

受夠了在沙漠看著海市蜃樓的日子

(Might've been)

And I know I sound dramatic, but that's just how it feels"

我每次都好像演的很誇張，但就是這麼嚴重

She said, "I'm holdin' to the notion that I'll find something real"

我一直覺得我能抓住真正的東西

[Chorus]

Yeah, I just want to be wanted, oh

我只是想被想要

I could use a little love sometimes

可以付出我的一些小愛

I just need to be needed, oh

我只是想被需要

Like to know I'm crossin' someone's mind

就好比我在你的記憶中穿梭

I just want to be someone that somebody needs

I just want to be more than a drop in the sea

我不想只是一個被丟進海裡的石頭

[Bridge]

I just want to be wanted

我只是想要我的愛被需要

Oh yeah

We just want to be wanted

我只是想要被需要

Ooh

[Outro]

I just want to be wanted, oh

我只是想被想要

I could use a little love sometimes

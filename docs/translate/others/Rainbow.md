[Verse 1]

When it rains, it pours

天空下起傾盆大雨

But you didn't even notice

但你沒有意識到

It ain't rainin' anymore

雨停止了

It's hard to breathe when all you know is

你卻被水淹的無法呼吸

The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line

你在深水中不斷掙扎

[Chorus]

Well, the sky has finally opened

但已經雨過天晴了

The rain and wind stopped blowin'

冷雨不再落下，涼風不再吹拂

But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again

但是你被自己的颶風困在中間

You hold tight to your umbrella

你緊緊的握著雨傘

Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya

但，親愛的，讓我告訴你

That there's always been a rainbow

彩虹已經出現囉

Hangin' over your head

放下雨傘往天空看看吧

[Verse 2]

If you could see what I see

若你能透過我的眼看世界

You'd be blinded by the colors

你會被七彩斑斕的世界吸引住

Yellow, red, and orange, and green

紅橙黃綠藍靛紫

And at least a million others

還有好多有趣的東西

So tie up the boat, take off your coat

駛離你的港灣，脫下你的外套

And take a look around

看看身旁的美景吧

[Chorus]

Cause the sky has finally opened

但已經雨過天晴了

The rain and wind stopped blowin'

冷雨不再落下，涼風不再吹拂

But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again

但是你被自己的颶風困在中間

You hold tight to your umbrella

你緊緊的握著雨傘

Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya

但，親愛的，讓我告訴你

That there's always been a rainbow

彩虹已經出現囉

Hangin' over your head

放下雨傘往天空看看吧

[Bridge]

Oh tie up the boat, take off your coat

駛離你的港灣，脫下你的外套

And take a look around

看看身旁的美景吧

Everything is alright now

沒事的

[Chorus]

'Cause the sky has finally opened

但已經雨過天晴了

The rain and wind stopped blowin'

冷雨不再落下，涼風不再吹拂

But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again

但是你被自己的颶風困在中間

You hold tight to your umbrella

你緊緊的握著雨傘

Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya

但，親愛的，讓我告訴你

That there's always been a rainbow

彩虹已經出現囉

Hangin' over your head

放下雨傘往天空看看吧

That there's always been a rainbow

彩虹已經出現囉

Hangin' over your head

放下雨傘往天空看看吧

[Outro]

Mmm

It'll all be alright

一切沒事的

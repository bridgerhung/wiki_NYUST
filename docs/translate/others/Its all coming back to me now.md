[Verse 1]  
There were nights when the wind was so cold  
這些夜晚高風，冷卻了我的身心  
That my body froze in bed if I just listened to it  
我的身子在床上冷得直顫抖，  
Right outside the window  
我聽著窗外颯颯飆奏的風聲  
There were days when the sun was so cruel  
有些嚴嚴酷日，太陽熱情的烤炙著大地    
That all the tears turned to dust  
我的淚，成了塵  
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever (Forever)  
爾後再也流不出淚來了  
I finished crying in the instant that you left  
在你走出門的剎那，我就收起眼淚  
And I can't remember where or when or how  
我甚至不記得當時發生了甚麼  
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made  
我流放我倆了那一幀幀的回憶  
  
[Chorus 1]  
But when you touch me like this  
但當你輕輕的觸碰我  
And you hold me like that  
當你溫柔的抱住我  
I just have to admit  
我必須得承認  
That it's all coming back to me  
那些塵封的記憶，一一閃回  
When I touch you like this  
當我輕輕地撫摸你  
And I hold you like that  
當我溫柔地抱住你  
It's so hard to believe  
難以置信  
But it's all coming back to me  
但那些場景，似乎再次浮現  
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)  
  
[Verse 2]  
There were moments of gold  
我們曾有屬於彼此的黃金時代  
And there were flashes of light  
我們就如天上的星星放光芒  
There were things I'd never do again  
有些事錯的不肯再做  
But then they'd always seemed right  
但當下卻如此水到渠成  
There were nights of endless pleasure  
每個充滿愛趣的夜裡  
It was more than any laws allow  
都是超越法律的存在  
Baby, baby  
寶貝，寶貝
  
[Chorus 2]  
If I kiss you like this  
若我輕輕地吻你  
And if you whisper like that  
若你在我耳邊輕輕耳語  
It was lost long ago  
這逝去許久  
But it's all coming back to me  
但一切都回到我身邊  
If you want me like this  
若你想要這樣的我  
And if you need me like that  
而你也如此的需要我  
It was dead long ago  
這已逝去許久  
But it's all coming back to me  
但一切都回到我身邊  
It's so hard to resist  
這如潮水般湧來  
And it's all coming back to me  
一切都回到我身邊  
I can barely recall  
回憶模糊不清  
But it's all coming back to me now  
但現在卻清晰可見  
But it's all coming back  
那些場景，似乎再次浮現  
  
[Verse 3]  
There were those empty threats and hollow lies  

And whenever you tried to hurt me  
I just hurt you even worse, and so much deeper  
There were hours that just went on for days  
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances  
That were lost to us forever (Forever)  
But you were history with the slamming of the door  
And I made myself so strong again somehow  
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then  
  
[Chorus 3]  
But if I touch you like this  
And if you kiss me like that  
It was so long ago  
But it's all coming back to me  
If you touch me like this  
And if I kiss you like that  
It was gone with the wind  
But it's all coming back to me  
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)  
  
[Verse 4]  
There were moments of gold  
And there were flashes of light  
There were things we'd never do again  
But then they'd always seemed right  
There were nights of endless pleasure  
It was more than all your laws allow  
Baby, baby, baby  
  
[Chorus 4]  
When you touch me like this  
And when you hold me like that  
It was gone with the wind  
But it's all coming back to me  
When you see me like this  
And when I see you like that  
Then we see what we want to see  
All coming back to me  
The flesh and the fantasies  
All coming back to me  
I can barely recall  
But it's all coming back to me now  
  
[Chorus 5]  
If you forgive me all this  
If I forgive you all that  
We forgive and forget  
And it's all coming back to me  
When you see me like this  
And when I see you like that  
We see just what we want to see  
All coming back to me  
The flesh and the fantasies  
All coming back to me  
I can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now  
  
[Outro]  
(It's all coming back to me now)  
And when you kiss me like this  
(It's all coming back to me now)  
And when I touch you like that  
(It's all coming back to me now)  
And if you do it like this  
(It's all coming back to me now)  
And if we

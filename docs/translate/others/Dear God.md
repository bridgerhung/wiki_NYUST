## 翻譯
[Verse 1]

Here I go again

無限輪迴

Three glasses in, counting my sins

灌了三杯酒，清算我的罪過

Home alone again

孤獨回家

It's three in the morning

早上頭痛的三點

Just me and my demons at war again

我在和心中的惡魔對抗

So I'm calling in, are you listening?

我呼召你的名子，你是否回應

[Pre-Chorus]

You made a man this fragile

你讓我易碎

You made a heart that can break

你鑄了一顆易碎的心

You showed me the road less traveled

你帶我走了一條崎嶇的路

Knowin' I'm gonna run away

算計我會逃跑

You make me love so hard

你讓愛結了冰霜

When everything I love just leaves

不解為何所愛都離我而去

Are you sure there's nothing wrong with me?

你確定造我時，沒忘記零件嗎？

[Chorus]

And why does my life have to hurt so much?

為何我的生命必須傷痕累累

Why can't I find any peace or love?

為何感受不到一絲絲的愛

And why do I feel like I'm not enough?

為何我總覺得心中缺那一角

Dear God, are you sure that you don't mess up?

神啊，你為什麼要這樣搞我

[Verse 2]

Can we still call it praying if all that I do is

就算我不停的在詛咒神的名號

sitting here cursing, cursing your name again?

坐著閉眼，依舊算是禱告嗎？

The truth is it's not even you

但事實上，你都算不上

It's just me that I'm up against

我只是在對抗我自己

But you made me this

但是你造成的

Can we share the blame for this? Mmm

請問你能夠為此負責嗎？

[Pre-Chorus]

'Cause after all, You made a man this fragile

因為，你讓我易碎

You made a heart that can break

你鑄了一顆易碎的心

You showed me the road less traveled

你帶我走了一條崎嶇的路

Knowin' I'm gonna run away

算計我會逃跑

You make me love so hard

你讓愛結了冰霜

When everything I love just leaves

不解為何所愛都離我而去

Are you sure there's nothing wrong with me?

你確定造我時，沒忘記零件嗎？

[Chorus]

And why does my life have to hurt so much?

為何我的生命必須傷痕累累

Why can't I find any peace or love?

為何感受不到一絲絲的愛

And why do I feel like I'm not enough?

為何我總覺得心中缺那一角

Dear God, are you sure that you don't, that you don't mess up?

上帝，你確定你沒有搞砸我嗎？

You don't mess up

但你沒有搞砸

I know you don't mess up, I know that you don't mess up

我知道你什麼都沒有作，我知道你什麼都沒有作

[Bridge]

I know this ain't for nothing

我知道呼喊只是徒勞

There's nothing you don't make

你掌管著一切

I know you got your reasons

我知道你有這樣做的原因

This shit's just hard to take

但這檻，我就是跨不過

I don't mean to criticize you

我並不是有意苛責

I know I'm hard to teach

我知道我脾氣硬，難領悟

I know you tell me there's nothing wrong with me

我知道我沒有缺陷

[Chorus]

Yeah, but why does my life have to hurt so much?

但，為何我必須傷痕累累

And why can't I find any peace or love?

為何感受不到一絲絲的愛

And why do I feel like I'm not enough?

為何我總覺得心中缺那一角

Dear God, are you sure that you don't, that you don't mess up?

上帝，你確定你沒有搞砸我嗎？

You don't mess up

但你沒有搞砸

I know you don't mess up, yeah

我知道你什麼都沒有作

Dear God, just remind me you don't mess up

神，請告訴我，我是完整的

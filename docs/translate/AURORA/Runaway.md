[Verse 1]  
I was listening to the ocean  
我正感受著海風的聲音  
I saw a face in the sand  
海沙拂過我的臉頰  
But when I picked it up  
當我拾起沙  
Then it vanished away from my hands, gone  
卻如流水般緩緩流逝  
I had a dream I was seven  
在七歲時的一場夢  
Climbing my way in a tree  
爬上一高聳的大樹  
I saw a piece of heaven  
我看到前往天堂的入口  
Waiting impatient for me, down  
不耐煩的招我引入  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I was running far away  
我正想遠遠的逃離這個地方  
Would I run off the world someday?  
我是否有一天可以逃離這個世界  
Nobody knows, nobody knows  
沒有人懂，也沒有人知道  
And I was dancing in the rain  
我在雨中飛舞  
I felt alive and I can't complain  
我感到為生者且釋懷  
  
[Chorus]  
But now take me home  
但，請帶我回家  
Take me home where I belong  
回到我出生的地方  
I can't take it anymore  
我想趕快回家  
  
[Verse 2]  
I was painting a picture  
我正在畫幅畫  
The picture was a painting of you  
在紙上著上你的模樣  
And for a moment I thought you were here  
一時半刻我以為，你就在我的眼前  
But then again, it wasn't true, gone  
但你的模樣只是海市蜃樓  
And all this time I have been lying  
我總是在欺騙我自己  
Oh, lying in secret to myself  
隱藏我心中深刻的秘密  
I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf  
我總是將悲傷封存在心底的最深處  
La-di-da  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I was running far away  
我正想遠遠的逃離這個地方  
Would I run off the world someday?  
我是否有一天可以逃離這個世界  
Nobody knows, nobody knows  
沒有人懂，也沒有人知道  
And I was dancing in the rain  
我在雨中飛舞  
I felt alive and I can't complain  
我感到為生者且釋懷

But now take me home  
帶我回家  
Take me home where I belong  
回到我的歸屬  
I got no other place to go  
我無處可去

And I kept running for a soft place to fall

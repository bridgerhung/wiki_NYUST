## 翻譯
[Intro]  
My, my, my, my  
  
[Chorus]  
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts  
說再見宛如身重千百斬  
Flashbacks waking me up  
惡夢嚇醒了我  
I get drunk, but it's not enough  
我灌醉自己，但這還不夠  
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby  
因為陽光再度昇起，你不是我的  
I look through the windows of this love  
我透過窗戶看著這份愛  
Even though we boarded them up  
即使他早就被我們用木板封塵  
Chandelier's still flickering here  
吊燈依舊高掛閃爍  
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not  
因為我沒辦法裝作毫不在意  
It's death by a thousand cuts  
因為身中千百斬，刀刀進骨肉  
  
[Verse 1]  
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home  
我藉著裝扮自己來消磨時間，我故意繞原遠路回家  
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright  
我抬頭問這樣紅綠燈，一切會好起來嗎  
They say, "I don't know"  
他說：我不知道  
And what once was ours is no one's now  
曾經屬於我們的，現在已煙飛雲散  
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share  
Is this small town  
走到何處無不見你，我們共享這小小的地方  
You said it was a great love, one for the ages  
你說這是偉大的愛，史詩般的愛  
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?  
但如果故事已經畫下句點，我為何還在續寫  
  
[Chorus]  
’Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts  
說再見宛如身重千百斬  
Flashbacks waking me up  
惡夢嚇醒了我  
I get drunk, but it's not enough  
我灌醉自己，但這還不夠  
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby  
因為陽光再度昇起，你不是我的  
I look through the windows of this love  
我透過窗戶看著這份愛  
Even though we boarded them up  
即使他早就被我們用木板封塵  
Chandelier's still flickering here  
吊燈依舊高掛閃爍  
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not  
因為我沒辦法裝作毫不在意  
It's death by a thousand cuts  
因為身中千百斬，刀刀進骨肉 
   
[Verse 2]  
My heart, my hips, my body, my love  
我的心，我身上的一切，我的愛  
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch  
想知道有哪個部位是你未觸及的  
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug  
但你把我像個棄子丟掉  
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club  
現在我只能在你出現的酒吧，找尋你的訊號  
Our songs, our films, united we stand  
我們的國歌，我們的回憶，捍衛  
Our country, guess it was a lawless land  
我們的國家，曾經是最自由的國度  
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand  
藉著撫摸你的手，安撫我的恐懼  
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans  
曾經的史詩現在如碎片割傷著我  
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust  
我的時間，酒，我的靈魂，我的信賴  
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up  
想知道有哪個部位是你未觸及的  
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough  
我曾給你許多，但遠遠不夠  
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts  
我會好起來，不過是身中千百斬  
  
[Chorus]  
I get drunk, but it's not enough  
我灌醉自己，但這還不夠  
'Cause you're not my baby  
因為，你不是我的  
I look through the windows of this love  
我透著窗戶看著這份愛  
Even though we boarded them up  
即使他早就被我們用木板封塵  
Chandelier's still flickering here  
吊燈依舊高掛閃爍  
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not  
因為我沒辦法裝作毫不在意  
No, it's not  
不能裝作不在意  
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)  
因為身中千百斬，刀刀進骨肉  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch  
想知道有哪個部位是你未觸及的  
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)  
我的身體，我的愛，我的信賴  
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no  
但遠遠不夠，遠遠不夠  
  
[Outro]  
I take the long way home  
我故意繞遠路回家  
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright  
我問天上的紅綠燈，我會好起來嗎？  
They say, "I don't know"  
他說，我不知道

Wish You were gay

[Verse 1]

"Baby, I don't feel so good,"

寶貝我從沒好些

six words you never understood

傾吐的六字你依舊不解

"I'll never let you go,"

「我絕對不放手」

five words you'll never say (Aww)

你從未說過的那五字

I laugh along like nothing's wrong,

使我那般笑歷盡滄桑

four days has never felt so long

那四日度日如年

If three's a crowd and two was us,

曾經的兩人一起成了三人同行

one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha)

而我悄悄溜走

[Chorus]

I just wanna make you feel okay

我就只是想讓你過好點

But all you do is look the other way

但你總是對我做的視而不見

I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay

你不知道，我留下有多不情願

I just kinda wish you were gay

我就希望你是個Gay

[Verse 2]

Is there a reason we're not through?

是否有原因，使我們無法配對

Is there a 12 step just for you?

十二步距離，就是跨不出第一步

Our conversation's all in blue

我傳的訊息一個也沒回

11 "heys" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

螢幕只有11個嘿

Ten fingers tearin' out my hair

十根手指撥著我的頭髮

Nine times you never made it there

九次的吻，從未到達

I ate alone at 7,

你六分前消失

you were six minutes away

七點讓我獨自飲恨

(Yay)

[Chorus]

How am I supposed to make you feel okay

我該怎麼讓你過好點

When all you do is walk the other way?

你總是沒我想的好一點

I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay

你不知道，我留下有多不情願

I just kinda wish you were gay

我就希望你是個Gay

[Bridge]

To spare my pride

我放下我的自尊

To give your lack of interest an explanation

對你的不感興趣做出一個解釋

Don't say I'm not your type

別說我不是你的菜

Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual

orientation

就說我不是你喜歡的那種性向

I'm so selfish

我好自私

But you make me feel helpless, yeah

但你讓我無助又想哭

And I can't stand another day

讓我覺得天塌下來

Stand another day

度不過今天

[Chorus]

I just wanna make you feel okay

我就只是想讓你過好點

But all you do is look the other way

但你總是對我做的視而不見

I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay

你不知道，我留下有多不情願

I just kinda wish you were gay

我就希望你是個Gay

I just kinda wish you were gay

我就希望你是個Gay

I just kinda wish you were gay

我就希望你是個Gay

Intro]  
Hmm-mm  
[Verse 1]  
Wake up and smell the coffee  
在濃郁的咖啡香醒來  
Is your cup half full or empty?  
你的咖啡是全滿還是半杯？ （你是想積極應對，還是放著隨便）  
When we talk, you say it softly  
你輕輕的講，我輕輕的回  
But I love it when you're awfully quiet  
但我也喜歡你讓令人敬畏的無聲  
Hmm-mm, quiet  
寧靜的感覺  
Hmm-mm  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You see the piece of paper  
桌上的，是一張白紙  
Could be a little greater  
空白，但有無盡的創意  
Show me what you could make her  
讓我看看，你揮灑出什麼吧！  
You'll never know until you try it  
不試試，哪知道會畫出什麼呢？  
Hmm-mm  
And you don't have to keep it quiet  
你不需要如此沉默的  
[Chorus]  
And I know it makes you nervous  
我知道你心中伴著恐懼和不安  
But I promise you, it's worth it  
但我保證，絕對值得  
To show 'em everything you kept inside  
讓他們看看你腹中的墨水  
Don't hide, don't hide  
別害羞，別隱藏  
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay  
害羞也沒關係，但別逃跑  
Don't hide away  
別躲到暗處去了  
Come out and play  
出來玩玩吧  
[Verse 2]  
Look up, out of your window  
抬頭，看看窗外的景致  
See snow, won't let it in though  
看看飄搖的雪，不會冷到你的  
Leave home, feel the wind blow  
出門走走吧，感受外頭的涼風  
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence  
因為裡頭的寂靜無聲 凍著我了  
And you don't have to keep it quiet  
你不需要什麼都不說的  
[Chorus]  
And I know it makes you nervous  
我知道你心中伴著恐懼和不安  
But I promise you, it's worth it  
但我保證，絕對值得  
To show 'em everything you kept inside  
讓他們看看你腹中的墨水  
Don't hide, don't hide  
別害羞，別隱藏  
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay  
害羞也沒關係，但別逃跑  
Don't hide away  
別躲到暗處去了  
Come out and play  
出來玩玩吧
